In Chapter 3, we have lear nt that atoms and
molecules ar e the fundamental building
blocks of matter . The existence of dif ferent
kinds of matter is due to dif ferent atoms
constituting them. Now the questions arise:
(i) What makes the atom of one element
differ
ent fr om the atom of another element?
and (ii) Ar e atoms r eally indivisible, as
proposed by Dalton, or ar e ther e smaller
constituents inside the atom? W e shall find
out the answers to these questions in this
chapter . We will lear n about sub-atomic
particles and the various models that have
been pr oposed to explain how these particles
are arranged within the atom.
A major challenge before the scientists at
the end of the 19th century was to r eveal the
structur e of the atom as well as to explain its
important pr operties. The elucidation of the
structur e of atoms is based on a series of
experiments.
One of the first indications that atoms ar e
not indivisible, comes fr om studying static
electricity and the condition under which
electricity is conducted by dif ferent
substances.
4.1Charged Particles in Matter
For understanding the natur e of char ged
particles in matter , let us carry out the
following activities:
Activity ______________ 4.1
A.Comb dry hair . Does the comb then
attract small pieces of paper?
B.Rub a glass r od with a silk cloth and
bring the r od near an inflated balloon.
Observe what happens.From these activities, can we conclude
that on rubbing two objects together , they
become electrically char ged? Wher e does this
charge come fr om? This question can be
answer ed by knowing that an atom is divisible
and consists of char ged particles.
Many scientists contributed in r evealing
the pr esence of charged particles in an atom.
It was known by 1900 that the atom was
indivisible particle but contained at least one
sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by
J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was
identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the
presence of new radiations  in a gas discharge
and called them canal rays. These rays were
positively charged radiations which ultimately
led to the discovery of another sub-atomic
particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,
equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that
of the electron. Its mass was approximately
2000 times as that of the electron. It was given
the name of proton. In general, an electron is
represented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The
mass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its
charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is
considered to be negligible and its charge is
minus one.
It seemed that an atom was composed of
protons and electrons, mutually balancing
their charges. It also appeared that the protons
were in the interior of the atom, for whereas
electrons could easily be removed off but
not protons. Now the big question was:
what sort of structure did  these particles of
the atom for m? W e will find the answer to
this question below.4

2.If an atom contains one electron
and one pr oton, will it carry any
charge or not?
4.2The Structure of an Atom
We have lear nt Dalton’s atomic theory in
Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom
was indivisible and indestructible. But the
discovery of two fundamental particles
(electr ons and pr otons) inside the atom, led
to the failur e of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic
theory. It was then consider ed necessary to
know how electr ons and pr otons ar e arranged
within an atom. For explaining this, many
scientists pr oposed various atomic models.
J.J. Thomson was the first one to pr opose a
model for the structure of an atom.
4.2.1 THOMSON ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM
Thomson proposed the model of an atom to
be similar to that of a Christmas pudding.
The electrons, in a spher e of positive charge,
were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical
Christmas pudding. W e can also think of a
water melon, the positive char ge in the atom
is spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of
the water melon, while the electr ons ar e
studded in the positively char ged spher e, like
the seeds in the water melon (Fig. 4.1).Thomson pr oposed that:
(i)An atom consists of a positively
charged spher e and the electr ons ar e
embedded in it.
(ii)The negative and positive char ges ar e
equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a
whole is electrically neutral.
Although Thomson’s model explained that
atoms ar e electrically neutral, the results of
experiments carried out by other scientists
could not be explained by this model, as we
will see below.
4.2.2 RUTHERFORD ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM
Ernest Ruther ford was inter ested in knowing
how the electr ons ar e arranged within an
atom. Ruther ford designed an experiment for
this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha
(α)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin
gold foil.
•He selected a gold foil because he wanted
as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil
was about 1000 atoms thick.
•α-particles ar e doubly-char ged helium
ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the
fast-moving α-particles have a
considerable amount of ener gy.
•It was expected that α-particles would be
deflected by the sub-atomic particles in
the gold atoms. Since the α-particles wer e
much heavier than the pr otons, he did
not expect to see lar ge deflections.Q
Fig.4.1:  Thomson’s model of an atomJ.J. Thomson (1856–
1940),  a British
physicist, was born in
Cheetham Hill, a suburb
of Manchester , on
18 December 1856. He
was awarded the Nobel
prize in Physics in 1906
for his work on the
discovery of electrons. He
directed the Cavendish Laboratory at
Cambridge for 35 years and seven of his
research assistants subsequently won
Nobel prizes.

SCIENCE 40Fig. 4.2: Scattering of α-particles by a gold foil
But, the α -particle scatterin g experiment
gave totally unexpected r esults (Fig. 4.2).  The
following observations wer e made:
(i)Most of the fast moving α-particles
passed straight thr ough the gold foil.
(ii)Some of the α-particles were deflected
by the foil by small angles.
(iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000
particles appear ed to rebound.
In the wor ds of Ruther ford, “This r esult
was almost as incr edible as if you fir e a
15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it
comes back and hits you ”.He will hear a sound when each stone strikes
the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will
hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded
child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire
fence, most of the stones would not hit the
fencing and no sound would be heard. This is
because there are lots of gaps in the fence
which allow the stone to pass through them.
Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford
concluded fr om the α-particle scattering
experiment that—
(i)Most of the space inside the atom is
empty because most of the α -particles
passed thr ough the gold foil without
getting deflected.
(ii) V ery few particles were deflected fr om
their path, indicating that the positive
charge of the atom occupies very little
space.
(iii) A very small fraction of α-particles
were deflected by 1800, indicating that
all the positive char ge and mass of the
gold atom were concentrated in a very
small volume within the atom.
From the data he also calculated that the
radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less
than the radius of the atom.
On the basis of his experiment,
Ruther ford put forwar d the nuclear model of
an atom, which had the following featur es:
(i)There is a positively char ged centr e in
an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all
the mass of an atom r esides in the
nucleus.
(ii)The electr ons r evolve ar ound the
nucleus in circular paths.
(iii) The size of the nucleus is very small
as compar ed to the size of the atom.
Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of
the atom
The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit
is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a
circular orbit would undergo acceleration.
During acceleration, charged particles would
radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron
would lose energy and finally fall into the
nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be
highly unstable and hence matter would not
exist in the for m that we know. W e know that
atoms are quite stable.E. Rutherford (1871–1937)
was bor n at Spring Gr ove
on 30 August 1871. He was
known as the ‘Father’ of
nuclear physics.  He is
famous for his work on
radioactivity and the
discovery of the nucleus of an atom with
the gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel
prize in chemistry in 1908.

In order to overcome the objections raised
against Ruther ford’s model of the atom,
Neils Bohr put forwar d the following
postulates about the model of an atom:
(i)Only certain special orbits known as
discrete orbits  of electr ons, ar e allowed
inside the atom.

4.2.4 NEUTRONS
In 1932, J. Chadwick discover ed another sub-
atomic particle which had no char ge and a
mass nearly equal to that of a pr oton. It was
eventually named as neutr on. Neutr ons ar e
present in the nucleus of all atoms, except
hydr ogen. In general, a neutr on is
represented as ‘n’. The mass of an atom is
therefor e given by the sum of the masses of
protons and neutr ons pr esent in the nucleus.

4.3How are Electrons Distributed
in Different Orbits (Shells)?
The distribution of electr ons into dif ferent
orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr
and Bury.
The following rules are followed for writing
the number of electr ons in dif ferent ener gy
levels or shells:
(i)The maximum number of electr ons
present in a shell is given by theNeils Bohr (1885–1962)
was bor n in Copenhagen
on 7 October 1885. He was
appointed pr ofessor of
physics at Copenhagen
University in 1916. He got
the Nobel prize for his work
on the structur e of atom in
1922. Among Pr ofessor
Bohr’s numer ous writings, thr ee appearing
as books ar e:
(i) The Theory of Spectra and Atomic
Constitution, (ii) Atomic Theory and,
(iii) The Description of Natur e.
These orbits or shells are called energy
levels. Energy levels in an atom ar e shown in
Fig. 4.3.Q

Hence the maximum number of
electrons in different shells are as

second orbit or L-shell will be = 2 × 22 = 8,
third orbit or M-shell will be = 2 × 32 = 18,

can be accommodated in the outermost
orbit is 8.
(iii)Electrons are not accommodated in a
given shell, unless the inner shells are
filled. That is, the shells are filled in a
step-wise manner .

We have lear nt how the electr ons in an atom
are arranged in dif ferent shells/orbits. The
electr ons pr esent in the outer most shell of
an atom ar e known as the valence electr ons.
From the Bohr -Bury scheme, we also know

was observed that the atoms of elements,
completely filled with 8 electrons in the
outermost shell show little chemical activity.
In other words, their combining capacity or
valency is zero. Of these inert elements, the

STRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 43Table 4.1: Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements
with Electron Distribution in Various Shells
helium atom has two electrons in its outermost
shell and all other elements have atoms with
eight electrons in the outermost shell.
The combining capacity of the atoms of
elements, that is, their tendency to react and
form molecules with atoms of the same or
different elements, was thus explained as an
attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.
An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons
was said to possess an octet. Atoms would
thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the
outermost shell. This was done by sharing,
gaining or losing electrons. The number of
electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make
the octet of electrons in the outermost shell,
gives us directly the combining capacity of theelement, that is, the valency discussed in the
previous chapter . For example, hydr ogen/
lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron
each in their outermost shell, therefore each
one of them can lose one electron. So, they are
said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what
is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It
is two and three, respectively, because
magnesium has two electrons in its outermost
shell and aluminium has thr ee electr ons in
its outer most shell.
If the number of electr ons in the
outer most shell of an atom is close to its full
capacity, then valency is deter mined in a
different way. For example, the fluorine atom
has 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its
valency could be 7. But it is easier forName of Symbol Atomic Number Number Number Vale-

by subtracting seven electrons from the octet

Valency can be calculated in a similar manner
for oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that
you get from this calculation?

4.5Atomic Number and Mass

4.5.1 ATOMIC  NUMBER
We know that pr otons ar e present in the
nucleus of an atom. It is the number of
protons of an atom, which deter mines its
atomic number . It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms
of an element have the same atomic number ,
Z. In fact, elements ar e defined by the number
of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,
because in hydr ogen atom, only one proton
is pr esent in the nucleus. Similarly, for
carbon, Z = 6. Ther efore, the atomic number
is defined as the total number of pr otons
present in the nucleus of an atom.
4.5.2 MASS
 NUMBER
After studying the pr operties of the sub-
atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude
that mass of an atom is practically due to
protons and neutr ons alone. These ar e
present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence
protons and neutr ons ar e also called
nucleons. Ther efore, the mass of an atom
resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of
carbon is 12 u because it has 6 pr otons and6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the
mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14
neutrons). The mass number is defined as the
sum of the total number of protons and
neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It
is denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom,
the atomic number , mass number and symbol
of the element are to be written as:
Mass Number

2.With the help of T able 4.1, find
out the mass number of oxygen
and sulphur atom.
4.6Isotopes
In natur e, a number of atoms of some
elements have been identified, which have the
same atomic number but dif ferent mass
numbers. For example, take the case of
hydrogen atom, it has thr ee atomic species,
namely pr otium (1
1H), deuterium (2
1H or D)
and tritium (3
1H or T). The atomic number of
each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2
and 3, r espectively. Other such examples ar e
(i) carbon, 12
6C and 14
6C, (ii) chlorine,  35
17Cl
and  37
17Cl, etc.
On the basis of these examples, isotopes
are defined as the atoms of the same element,
having the same atomic number but dif ferent
mass numbers. Ther efore, we can say that
there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,
namely protium, deuterium and tritium.QXA

isotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure
substance. The chemical pr operties of
isotopes ar e similar but their physical
properties ar e different.
Chlorine occurs in natur e in two isotopic
forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio
of 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what
should we take as the mass of chlorine atom?
Let us find out.

The mass of an atom of any natural element
is taken as the average mass of all the naturally
occuring atoms of that element. If an element
has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom
would be the same as the sum of protons and
neutrons in it. But if an element occurs in
isotopic forms, then we have to know the
percentage of each isotopic form and then the
average mass is calculated.
This does not mean that any one atom of
chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It
means that if you take a certain amount of
chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of
chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.Applications
Since the chemical properties of all the
isotopes of an element ar e the same,
normally we ar e not concer ned about
taking a mixture. But some isotopes have
special properties which find them useful
in various fields. Some of them are :
(i)An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel
in nuclear reactors.
(ii)An isotope of cobalt is used in the
treatment of cancer .
(iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the
treatment of goitr e.

atomic number 20, and ar gon, atomic
number 18. The number of protons in these
atoms is different, but the mass number of
both these elements is 40. That is, the total
number of nucleons is the same in the atoms
of this pair of elements. Atoms of different
elements with different atomic numbers, which
have the same mass number , ar

isobars.

STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM

In Chapter 3, we have learnt that atoms and
molecules are the fundamental building
blocks of matter. The existence of different
kinds of matter is due to different atoms
constituting them. Now the questions arise:
(i) What makes the atom of one element
different from the atom of another element?
and (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as
proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller
constituents inside the atom? We shall find
out the answers to these questions in this
chapter. We will learn about sub-atomic
particles and the various models that have
been proposed to explain how these particles
are arranged within the atom.

A major challenge before the scientists at
the end of the 19th century was to reveal the
structure of the atom as well as to explain its
important properties. The elucidation of the
structure of atoms is based on a series of
experiments.

One of the first indications that atoms are
not indivisible, comes from studying static
electricity and the condition under which
electricity is conducted by different
substances.

4.1 Charged Particles in Matter

For understanding the nature of charged
particles in matter, let us carry out the
following activities:

Activity

A. Comb dry hair. Does the comb then
attract small pieces of paper?

B. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and
bring the rod near an inflated balloon.
Observe what happens.

From these activities, can we conclude
that on rubbing two objects together, they
become electrically charged? Where does this
charge come from? This question can be
answered by knowing that an atom is divisible
and consists of charged particles.

Many scientists contributed in revealing
the presence of charged particles in an atom.

It was known by 1900 that the atom was
indivisible particle but contained at least one
sub-atomic particle — the electron identified by
J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was
identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the
presence of new radiations in a gas discharge
and called them canal rays. These rays were
positively charged radiations which ultimately
led to the discovery of another sub-atomic
particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,
equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that
of the electron. Its mass was approximately
2000 times as that of the electron. It was given
the name of proton. In general, an electron is
represented as ‘e” and a proton as ‘p*’. The
mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its
charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is
considered to be negligible and its charge is
minus one.

It seemed that an atom was composed of
protons and electrons, mutually balancing
their charges. It also appeared that the protons
were in the interior of the atom, for whereas
electrons could easily be removed off but
not protons. Now the big question was:
what sort of structure did these particles of
the atom form? We will find the answer to
this question below.

1. What are canal rays?

2. Ifanatom contains one electron
and one proton, will it carry any
charge or not?

4.2 The Structure of an Atom

We have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in
Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom
was indivisible and indestructible. But the
discovery of two fundamental particles
(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led
to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic
theory. It was then considered necessary to
know how electrons and protons are arranged
within an atom. For explaining this, many
scientists proposed various atomic models.
J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a
model for the structure of an atom.

4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM

Thomson proposed the model of an atom to
be similar to that of a Christmas pudding.
The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,
were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical
Christmas pudding. We can also think of a
watermelon, the positive charge in the atom
is spread all over like the red edible part of
the watermelon, while the electrons are
studded in the positively charged sphere, like
the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).

Positive sphere

Electron

Fig.4. 1: Thomson's model of an atom

STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM

Thomson proposed that:

(ij) An atom consists of a positively
charged sphere and the electrons are
embedded in it.

(ii) The negative and positive charges are
equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a
whole is electrically neutral.

Although Thomson’s model explained that

atoms are electrically neutral, the results of
experiments carried out by other scientists
could not be explained by this model, as we
will see below.

4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM

Ernest Rutherford was interested in knowing

how the electrons are arranged within an

atom. Rutherford designed an experiment for
this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha

(a)-particles were made to fall on a thin

gold foil.

e Heselected a gold foil because he wanted
as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil
was about 1000 atoms thick.
a-particles are doubly-charged helium
ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the
fast-moving a-particles have a
considerable amount of energy.

e It was expected that a-particles would be
deflected by the sub-atomic particles in
the gold atoms. Since the a-particles were
much heavier than the protons, he did
not expect to see large deflections.

a-particles

Fig. 4.2: Scattering of a-particles by a gold foil

But, the a-particle scattering experiment
gave totally unexpected results (Fig. 4.2). The
following observations were made:

(i) Most of the fast moving a-particles

passed straight through the gold foil.
(ii) Some of the a-particles were deflected
by the foil by small angles.
(iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000
particles appeared to rebound.

In the words of Rutherford, “This result
was almost as incredible as if you fire a
15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it
comes back and hits you”.

E. Rutherford (1871-193
was born at Spring Srov :
on 30 August 1871. He was

known as th ther’ of
nuclear He is
famous f is work on

radi tivity and the
fe o an atom with
ent. He got the Nobel

1908.

Let us think of an activity in an open field
to understand the implications of this
experiment. Let a child stand in front of a
wall with his eyes closed. Let him throw
stones at the wall from a distance.

40

He will hear a sound when each stone strikes
the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will
hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded
child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire
fence, most of the stones would not hit the
fencing and no sound would be heard. This is
because there are lots of gaps in the fence
which allow the stone to pass through them.

Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford
concluded from the a-particle scattering
experiment that—

(i) Most of the space inside the atom is
empty because most of the a-particles
passed through the gold foil without
getting deflected.

(ii) Very few particles were deflected from
their path, indicating that the positive
charge of the atom occupies very little
space.

(iii) A very small fraction of a-particles
were deflected by 180°, indicating that
all the positive charge and mass of the
gold atom were concentrated in a very
small volume within the atom.

From the data he also calculated that the
radius of the nucleus is about 10° times less
than the radius of the atom.

On the basis of his experiment,
Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of
an atom, which had the following features:

(i) There is a positively charged centre in
an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all
the mass of an atom resides in the
nucleus.

(ii) The electrons revolve around the
nucleus in circular paths.

(iii) The size of the nucleus is very small
as compared to the size of the atom.

Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of
the atom

The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit
is not expected to be stable. Any particle ina
circular orbit would undergo acceleration.
During acceleration, charged particles would
radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron
would lose energy and finally fall into the
nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be
highly unstable and hence matter would not
exist in the form that we know. We know that
atoms are quite stable.

4.2.3 BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOM

In order to overcome the objections raised
against Rutherford’s model of the atom,
Neils Bohr put forward the following
postulates about the model of an atom:

(i) Only certain special orbits known as
discrete orbits of electrons, are allowed
inside the atom.

(ii) While revolving in discrete orbits the
electrons do not radiate energy.

These orbits or shells are called energy
levels. Energy levels in an atom are shown in
Fig. 4.3.

4.2.4 NEUTRONS

In 1932, J. Chadwick discovered another sub-
atomic particle which had no charge and a
mass nearly equal to that of a proton. It was
eventually named as neutron. Neutrons are
present in the nucleus of all atoms, except
hydrogen. In general, a neutron is
represented as ‘n’. The mass of an atom is
therefore given by the sum of the masses of
protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.

uestions

1. Name the three sub-atomic
particles ofan atom.

2. Helium atom has an atomic mass
of 4 u and two protons in its
nucleus. How many neutrons
does it have?

4.3 Howare Electrons Distributed
in Different Orbits (Shells)?

The distribution of electrons into different
orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr
and Bury.

The following rules are followed for writing
the number of electrons in different energy
levels or shells:

(i) The maximum number of electrons

present in a shell is given by the

41

Rationalised 2023-24

formula 2n?, where ‘n’ is the orbit
number or energy level index, 1,2,3,....
Hence the maximum number of
electrons in different shells are as
follows:

first orbit or K-shell will be = 2 x 17 = 2,

second orbit or L-shell will be = 2 x 27= 8,
third orbit or M-shell will be = 2 x 37= 18,
fourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2 x 4?
= 32, and so on.

(ii) The maximum number of electrons that
can be accommodated in the outermost
orbit is 8.

(ii) Electrons are not accommodated in a
given shell, unless the inner shells are
filled. That is, the shells are filled ina
step-wise manner.

4.4 Valency

We have learnt how the electrons in an atom
are arranged in different shells/orbits. The
electrons present in the outermost shell of
an atom are known as the valence electrons.

that the outermost shell of an atom can

accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It
was observed that the atoms of elements,
completely filled with 8 electrons in the
outermost shell show little chemical activity.
In other words, their combining capacity or
valency is zero. Of these inert elements, the

helium atom has two electrons in its outermost
shell and all other elements have atoms with
eight electrons in the outermost shell.

The combining capacity of the atoms of
elements, that is, their tendency to react and
form molecules with atoms of the same or
different elements, was thus explained as an
attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell.
An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons
was said to possess an octet. Atoms would
thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the
outermost shell. This was done by sharing,
gaining or losing electrons. The number of
electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make
the octet of electrons in the outermost shell,
gives us directly the combining capacity of the

STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM

element, that is, the valency discussed in the
previous chapter. For example, hydrogen/
lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron
each in their outermost shell, therefore each
one of them can lose one electron. So, they are
said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what
is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It
is two and three, respectively, because
magnesium has two electrons in its outermost
shell and aluminium has three electrons in
its outermost shell.

If the number of electrons in the
outermost shell of an atom is close to its full
capacity, then valency is determined in a
different way. For example, the fluorine atom
has 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its
valency could be 7. But it is easier for

43

Rationalised 2023-24

fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing
seven electrons. Hence, its valency is determined
by subtracting seven electrons from the octet
and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine.
Valency can be calculated in a similar manner
for oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that
you get from this calculation?

Therefore, an atom of each element has a
definite combining capacity, called its valency.
Valency of the first eighteen elements is given
in the last column of Table 4.1.

4.5 Atomic Number and Mass
Number

4.5.1 ATOMIC NUMBER

We know that protons are present in the
nucleus of an atom. It is the number of
protons of an atom, which determines its
atomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms
of an element have the same atomic number,
Z. In fact, elements are defined by the number
of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,
because in hydrogen atom, only one proton
is present in the nucleus. Similarly, for
carbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number
is defined as the total number of protons
present in the nucleus of an atom.

4.5.2 MAss NUMBER

After studying the properties of the sub-
atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude
that mass of an atom is practically due to
protons and neutrons alone. These are
present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence
protons and neutrons are also called
nucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom
resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of
carbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and

AA

6 neutrons, 6u+6u= 12 u. Similarly, the
mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14
neutrons). The mass number is defined as the
sum of the total number of protons and
neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It
is denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom,
the atomic number, mass number and symbol
of the element are to be written as:

Mass Number

A
Symbol of

For example, nitrogen is written as N.

is 8 and number of protons is also
8, then <i) what is the atomic
numberof the atom? and (ii) what
is the.charge on the atom?

2. With the\help of Table 4.1, find
out the-¢mass number of oxygen
and sulphur atom.

4.6 Isotopes

In nature, a number of atoms of some
elements have been identified, which have the
same atomic number but different mass
numbers. For example, take the case of
hydrogen atom, it has three atomic species,

namely protium (}H), deuterium (7H or D)

and tritium G H or T). The atomic number of

each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2
and 3, respectively. Other such examples are

(i) carbon, '2C and ‘$C, (ii) chlorine, Cl

37
and 7 Cl, etc.

On the basis of these examples, isotopes
are defined as the atoms of the same element,
having the same atomic number but different
mass numbers. Therefore, we can say that
there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom,
namely protium, deuterium and tritium.

SCIENCE

Rationalised 2023-24

Many elements consist of a mixture of
isotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure
substance. The chemical properties of
isotopes are similar but their physical
properties are different.

Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic
forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio
of 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what
should we take as the mass of chlorine atom?
Let us find out.

The average atomic mass of chlorine atom,
on the basis of above data, will be

35 1 37 25
100 100
1
_ 105 37 _ 4? 355u
4 4 4

The mass of an atom of any natural element
is taken as the average mass of all the naturally
occuring atoms of that element. If an element
has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom
would be the same as the sum of protons and
neutrons in it. But if an element occurs in
isotopic forms, then we have to know the
percentage of each isotopic form and then the
average mass is calculated.

This does not mean that any one atom of
chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It
means that if you take a certain amount of
chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of
chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.

learnt

Applications

Since the chemical properties of all the
isotopes of an element are the same,
normally we are not concerned about
taking a mixture. But some isotopes have
special properties which find them useful
in various fields. Some of them are :
(i) An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel
in nuclear reactors.
(ii) An isotope of cobalt is used in the
treatment of cancer.
(iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the
treatment of goitre.

4.6.1 IsoBaARsS

Let us consider two elements — calcium,
atomic number 20, and argon, atomic
number 18. The number of protons in these
atoms is different, but the mass number of
both these elements is 40. That is, the total
number of nucleons is the same in the atoms
of this pair of elements. Atoms of different
elements with different atomic numbers, which
have the same mass number, are known as
isobars.

discovery of the atomic nucleus.

Rutherford’s model of the atom proposed that a very tiny
nucleus is present inside the atom and electrons revolve
around this nucleus. The stability of the atom could not be

Neils Bohr’s model of the atom was more successful. He
proposed that electrons are distributed in different shells with
discrete energy around the nucleus. If the atomic shells are
complete, then the atom will be stable and less reactive.

J. Chadwick discovered presence of neutrons in the nucleus of
an atom. So, the three sub-atomic particles of an atom are:

(i) electrons have negative charge. 
(ii) the mass and positive charge of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus. 
(iii) neutron exists in the nucleus. 
(iv) most of the space in atom is empty. 
Which of the above statements are correct? 
(a) (i) and (iii) (b) (ii) and (iv) (© () and (iv) (d) (iii) and (iv) 
Ans. (b) Points (i) and (iv) are correct. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and 
very small nucleus which have all the protons and neutrons. Positive charge is due to 
protons, as neutrons have no charge. Most of the space is empty because most of the 
alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil without any deflection. 
Electrons have negative charge, it was explained by Thomson. The existance of neutron 
was discovered by Chadwick. 
Q. 9 The ion of an element has 3 positive charges. Mass number of the atom is 
27 and the number of neutrons is 14. What is the number of electrons in 
the ion? 
@13 (b) 10 (© 14 @16 
Ans. (b) Given that, charge = + 3, mass number =27 and number of neutrons = 14 
Number of protons = atomic number 
Atomic number = mass number — number of neutrons =27 —14=13 
This is the atomic number of aluminium. 
Therefore, this element is aluminium (Al). 
Number of electrons in the Al atom = 13 
Number of electrons in the Al**ion =13 - 3= 10. 
As it is formed from the neutral atom by loss of 3 electrons.

Electronic configuration ;,Mg atom =2, 8 2 and that of 
Mg% ion =2,8 
Number of protons in Mg atom =2 + 8+ 2 = 12 
Number of neutrons in Mg atom =24 — 12 = 12 
[as mass number of Mg atom =24 and number of neutrons 
=mass number — number of protons] 
Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. 
Q. 11 In a sample of ethyl ethanoate (CH,CO0C,H;) the two oxygen atoms 
have the same number of electrons but different number of neutrons, 
which of the following is the correct reason for it? 
(a) One of the oxygen atoms have gained electrons 
(b) One of the oxygen atoms has gained two neutrons 
(c) The two oxygen atoms are isotopes 
(d) The two oxygen atoms are isobars 
@ Thinking Process 
Isobars of different elements have same mass number but different number of protons 
(and electrons). 
Ans (c¢) The two O-atoms in CH,COOC H; can have different number of neutrons only if the 
two O-atoms are isotopes. It is because, isotopes of an element have same number of 
protons (and electrons) but different number of neutrons. 
Q. 12 Elements with valency 1 are 
(@) alwayg metals (b) always metalloids 
(c) either metals or non-metals (d) always non-metals 
Ans. (c) Metals and non-metals both can have valency 1. 
Metals which have 1 valence electron and non-metals which have 7 valence electrons, 
have valency 1. It is because, metals loose their 1€~ and non-metals gain 1e~ to 
complete their octet. 
Q. 13 The first model of an atom was given by

Short Answer Type Questions 
Q. 19 Is it possible for the atom of an element to have one electron, one 
proton and no neutron. If so, name the element. 
@ Thinking Process 
1 proton means atomic number (Z) =1 
No neutron means, mass number (A)=p + n 
=1+0=1 
1 electron and 1 proton means that atom is electrically neutral. 
Hence, it is possible for the atom of an element to have one electron one proton and no 
neutron. 
Ans. The element is protium }H (an isotope of hydrogen). }H (protium) has one electron, one 
proton and no neutron. 
Q. 20 Write any two observations which support the fact that atoms are 
divisible. 
Ans. ‘Atoms are divisible’ is supported by the following facts 
(i) Formation of ionic compounds is possible due to the formation of ions which involves 
the transfer of electrons. 
(i) Presence of isotopes for the same element is possible due to the difference in the 
number of neutrons. 
Above observations show that atom is formed by different particles such as electrons, 
protons and neutrons, i.e., atom is divisible. 
Q. 21 Will **Cl and ¥ CL have different valencies? Justify your answer. 
Ans. No, Cl and ¥’Cl have same valency. *Cl and %’Cl are the isotopes. So, they have same 
number of protons and electrons and have the same atomic number viz. 17 
Hence, their electronic configuration and valencies are also the same 
KLM 
Electronic configuration = 2, 8 7 
Valency 8-7 =1 
Therefore, both of them have valency = 1 
Q. 22 Why did Rutherford select a gold foil in his c.-ray scattering experiment? 
Ans. Gold is a heavy metal with high mass number. A light metal cannot be used because on 
being hit by fast moving a-particle, the atom of light metal will be simply pushed forward 
and no scattering can occur. 
Moreover, gold is the best malleable metal. A very thin foil (= 1000 atoms thick) can be 
made from gold to get the clear observations.Structure of the Atom 515)

Its outer shell has complete octét. 
Hence, its valency = 0 
(b) It has electronic configuration 
L 
2 
It can easily gain one electron to complete its outermost octet. 
Hence, its valency = 1 
Q. 24 One electron is present in the outermost shell of the atom of an element 
X. What would be the nature and value of charge on the ion formed if 
this electron is removed from the outermost shell? 
Ans. Anelement X is a metal because one electron is present in the outermost shell i.e., 1 valence 
electron. When this valence electron is removed from the outermost shell, a cation (positive 
ion) will be formed with a charge of + 1. 
Q. 25 Write down the electron distribution of chlorine atom. How many 
electrons are there in the L-shell? Atomic number of chlorine is = 17. 
Ans. Atomic number of chlorine atom =17 
So, its electronic configuration is 
KalsoM 
28 
L shell of chlorine contains 8 electrons. 
Q. 26 In the atom of an element X, 6 electrons are present in the outermost 
shell. If it acquires noble gas configuration by accepting requisite 
number of electrons, then what would be the charge on the ion so 
formed? 
Ans. Element X has 6 electrons in the outermost shell. In order to acquire noble gas 
configuration, element X requires 2 electrons. So, the charge on the anion (X37) so formed 
is ~2.56 NCERT Exemplar (Class [{) Solutions

Q. 28 In response to a question, a student stated that in an atom, the number 
of protons-is greater than the number of neutrons, which in turn is 
greater than the number of electrons. Do you agree with the statement? 
Justify your answer. 
Ans. The given statement is not correct. 
According to this statement 
p>n>e 
But actually, number of protons is never greater than the number of neutrons. Number of 
neutrons can be equal to or greater than the number of protons because mass number is 
equal to double the atomic number or greater than double the atomic number. 
Of course, number of neutrons can be greater than the number of electrons because 
number of electrons = number of protons in the neutral atom.

Q. 88 Enlist the conclusions drawn by Rutherford from his a.-ray scattering 
experiment. 
Ans. Conclusion of Rutherford’s a-rays scattering experiment 
(i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the a-particles passed 
through thie gold foil without getting deflected. 
(i) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of 
the atom occupies very little space. 
(iiiy A very small fraction of a-particles were deflected by 180°, indicating that all the positive 
charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in very small volume within the 
atom. 
Q. 39 In what way is the Rutherford’s atomic model different from that of 
Thomson's atomic model? 
Ans. According to Thomson's model, an atom is a positively charged sphere in which electrons 
were embedded which neutralise the positive charge so that, the atom as a whole is 
electrically neutral. 
According to Rutherford's model of atom, the positive charge and mass of the atom are 
concentrated in the small nucleus in the centre of the atom and negatively charged 
electrons are distributed (revolving) around the nucleus.60 NCERT Exemplar (ClassIX) Solutions 
Q. 40 What were the drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of an-atom? 
Ans. Rutherford’s model could not explain the stability of the atom. This is because according to Rutherford’s model, an atom consists of a small heavy positively charged nucleus in the centre and the electrons were revolving around it. 
These revolving electrons would loose energy as they are the charged particles and due to acceleration charged particles would radiate energy. 
Thus, the orbit of the revolving electron will keep on becoming smaller and smaller, following aspiral path as shown in figure and uttimately the electron should fall into the nucleus. Inother 
words, the atom should collapse. 
Continuous loss of energy by a revolving electron 
Q. 41 What are the postulates of Bohr's model of an atom? 
Ans. The postulates of Bohr's mode/ of atom are as follows 
(i) In an atom, the electrons revole around the nucleus in certain definite circular paths called orbits or shells. These are represented by the letters K, L, M, N....... or the numbersn =1,2,3,4 ... 
Circular orbits or energy levels or shells around the nucleus 
(ii) The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the formula 2n?, where ‘n'is the orbit number or energy level index, 1,2, 3 ..... . Hence, the maximum number of electrons in different shells are as follows. 
First orbit (K shell) will be =2 x 12 =2, second orbit (or L shell) will be =2 x22 = 8, third orbit (M shell) will be =2 x 32 = 18 and s0 on. 
(iijy The maximum number of electrons that can be accomadated in the outermost orbit is 8. 
(iv) Electrons are not accomodated in a given shell, unless the inner shells are filled. That is the shells are filled in a step-wise manner. 
(v) While revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate energy.Structure of the Atom 61

Q. 8 Rutherford’s o:-particle scattering experiment showed that
(i) electrons have negative charge.
(ii) the mass and positive charge of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
(iii) neutron exists in the nucleus.
(iv) most of the space in atom is empty.
Which of the above statements are correct?
(a) (i) and (iii) (b) (ii) and (iv) (©) (i) and (iv) (d) (iii) and (iv)

Ans. (6) Points (ii) and (iv) are correct. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and
very small nucleus which have all the protons and neutrons. Positive charge is due to
protons, as neutrons have no charge. Most of the space is empty because most of the
alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil without any deflection.

Electrons have negative charge, it was explained by Thomson. The existance of neutron
was discovered = Chadwick.

Q. 9 The ion of an element has 3 positive charges. Mass number of the atom is
27 and the number of neutrons is 14. What is the number of electrons in
the ion?

(a) 13 (b) 10 (c) 14 (d) 16

Ans. (6) Given that, charge = + 3, mass number = 27 and number of neutrons = 14

Number of protons = atomic number

Atomic number = mass number — number of neutrons = 27 — 14=13
This is the atomic number of aluminium.

Therefore, this element is aluminium (Al).
Number of electrons in the Al atom = 13
Number of electrons in the Al°*ion = 13 — 3 = 10.

As it is formed from the neutral atom by loss of 3 electrons.

= mass number — number of protons]

Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

Q. 11 In a sample of ethyl ethanoate (CH,COOC,H.) the two oxygen atoms

have the same number of electrons but different number of neutrons,
which of the following is the correct reason for it?
(a) One of the oxygen atoms have gained electrons
(b) One of the oxygen atoms has gained two neutrons
(c) The two oxygen atoms are isotopes
(d) The two oxygen atoms are isobars
@ Thinking Process
Isobars of different elements have same mass number but different number of protons
(and electrons).

Ans (c) The two O-atoms in CH,COOC ,H, can have different number of neutrons only if the
two O-atoms are isotopes. It is because, isotopes of an element have same number of
protons (and electrons) but different number of neutrons.

Short Answer Type Questions

Q. 19 Is it possible for the atom of an element to have one electron, one
proton and no neutron. If so, name the element.

@ Thinking Process
1 proton means atomic number (Z) =1
No neutron means, mass number (A) =p +n
=1+0=1
1 electron and 1 proton means that atom is electrically neutral.

Hence, it is possible for the atom of an element to have one electron one proton and no
neutron.

Ans. The element is protium 1H (an isotope of hydrogen). iH (protium) has one electron, one
proton and no neutron.

Q. 20 Write any two observations which support the fact that atoms are
divisible.
Ans. ‘Atoms are divisible’ is supported by the following facts

(i) Formation of ionic compounds is possible due to the formation of ions which involves
the transfer of electrons.

(ii) Presence of isotopes for the same element is sh rt due to the difference in the
number of neutrons.

Above observations show that atom is formed by different —- such as electrons,
protons and neutrons, i.e., atom is divisible.

Q. 21 Will Cl and >’ Cl have different valencies? Justify your answer.

Ans. No, *°Cl and °’Ci have same valency. *Cl and °’Cl are the isotopes. So, they have same
number of protons and electrons. and have the same atomic number viz. 17
Hence, their electronic configuration and valencies are also the same

KLM
Electronic configuration = 2, 8, 7
Valency 8-7 =1

Therefore, both of them have valency = 1

Q. 22 Why did Rutherford select a gold foil in his o-ray scattering experiment?

Ans. Gold is a heavy metal with high mass number. A light metal cannot be used because on
being hit by fast moving o-particle, the atom of light metal will be simply pushed forward
and no scattering can occur.

Moreover, gold is the best malleable metal. A very thin foil (~ 1000 atoms thick) can be
made from gold to get the clear observations.

Q. 24 One electron is present in the outermost shell of the atom of an element
X. What would be the nature and value of charge on the ion formed if
this electron is removed from the outermost shell?

Ans. An element X is a metal because one electron is present in the outermost shell /.e., 1 valence

electron. When this valence electron is removed from the outermost shell, a cation (positive
ion) will be formed with a charge of + 1.

Q..25 Write down the electron distribution of chlorine atom. How many
electrons are there in the L-shell? Atomic number of chlorine is = 17.

Q. 28 In response to a question, a student stated that in an atom, the number
of protons-is greater than the number of neutrons, which in turn is
greater than the number of electrons. Do you agree with the statement?
Justify your answer.

Ans. The given statement is not correct.
According to this statement

p>n>e
But actually, number of protons is never greater than the number of neutrons. Number of
neutrons can be equal to or greater than the number of protons because mass number is
equal to double the atomic number or greater than double the atomic number.
Of course, number of neutrons can be greater than the number of electrons because
number of electrons = number of protons in the neutral atom.

Q. $8 Enlist the conclusions drawn by Rutherford from his o-ray scattering
experiment.
Ans. Conclusion of Rutherford’s a-rays scattering axperiment
(i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the a-particles passed
through the gold foil without getting deflected.
(ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of
the atom occupies very little space.

(iii) A very small fraction of o-particles were deflected by 180°, indicating that all the positive
charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in very small volume within the
atom.

Q. 39 In what way is the Rutherford’s atomic model different from that of
Thomson’s atomic model?

Ans. According to Thomson's model, an atom is a positively charged sphere in which electrons
were embedded which neutralise the positive charge so that, the atom as a whole is
electrically neutral.

According to Rutherford's model of atom, the positive charge and mass of the atom are
concentrated in the small nucleus in the centre of the atom and negatively charged
electrons are distributed (revolving) around the nucleus.

Q. 40 What were the drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of an-atom?

Ans. Rutherford's model could not explain the Stability of the atom. This is because according to
Rutherford’s model, an atom consists of a small heavy positively charged nucleus in the
centre and the electrons were revolving around it.

These revolving electrons would loose energy as they are the charged particles and due to
acceleration charged particles would radiate energy.

Thus, the orbit of the revolving electron will keep on becoming smaller and smaller, following
a spiral path as shown in figure and ultimately the electron should fall into the nucleus. Jn other
words, the atom should collapse.

(ii) The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the formula 2n?, where
'n' is the orbit number or energy level index, 1, 2, 3... . Hence, the maximum number of
electrons in different shells are as follows.

First orbit (K shell) will be = 2 x 1? = 2, second orbit (or L shell) will be = 2 x2? = 8 third
orbit (M shell) will be = 2 x 3° = 18 and so on.

(iii) The maximum number of electrons that can be accomadated in the outermost orbit is 8.

(iv) Electrons are not accomodated in a given shell, unless the inner shells are filled. That is
the shells are filled in a step-wise manner.

(v) While revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate energy.

STRUCTURE 
OF ATOM 
around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it 
was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now 
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in 
them which are called subatomic particles. 
Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has 
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral. 
Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire 
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very 
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge. 
Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus 
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral 
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus 
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. 
Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons, 
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not 
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and 
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together 
to give the structure of atom. ’- toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).Charged Particles in Matter 
If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass 
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the 
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that 
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod 
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The 
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments 
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible. 
DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON 
The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed 
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of 
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called 
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does 
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively 
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all 
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons. 
Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge 
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied, 
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving 
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic 
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron 
as follows. 
Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish lightin the above gas discharge 
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike 
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream 
of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of 
negatively charged particles called electrons. 
The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons 
are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms 
contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron 
and minus sign for negative charge).Characteristics of an Electron 
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about 7277 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which 
is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass 
1 
of an electron is @ u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-28 gram. The mass of an 
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored 
while calculating the atomic mass of an element. 
2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb of negative 
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-1° coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any 
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative 
charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one). 
DISCOVERY OF PROTON 
The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles 
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles 
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms 
contain positively charged particles called protons. 
The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When 
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge 
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of 
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge 
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases 
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses 
and different charges. 
Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles 
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from 
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus, 
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of 
an electron from a hydrogen atom. 
Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas 
sometimes credited with the discovery of positively  discharge tube (seen on the extreme left side in the 
charged subatomic particle called proton. The term above picture) is produced when invisible anode

Rutherford who showed it to be a hydrogen nucleus. The anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas in the 
So, the discoverer of proton is generally said tobe Ernest  discharge tube consist of positively charged particles 
Rutherford. called protons.The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms. 
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons 
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a 
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays. 
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest 
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively 
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton 
as follows. 
The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons 
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms 
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p* 
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge). 
Characteristics of a Proton 
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since 
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a 
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is 
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton 
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-# gram. 
2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron. 
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-° coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb 
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit 
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative 
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one). 
The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low 
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation 
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the 
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them. 
DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON 
After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot 
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom 
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So, 
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong 
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units? 
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932. 
This particle is called neutron. The neutron is a neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom. 
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain 
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen 
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n. 
Characteristics of a Neutron 
The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the 
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-2 gram. 
208 : D el L2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral. 
We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon 
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6 
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now, 
Atomic mass = Mass of + Mass of 
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons 
6x1+6x1 
12u 
Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons 
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored. Figure 6. James Chadwick: 
We will now compare a proton, a neutron and an electron in respect The scientist who

STRUCTURE OF ATOM 
Dalton's atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible — which could not be broken down into 
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom 
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that 
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons 
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom 
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson 
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below. 
THOMSON'’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were 
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom: 
1. An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons 
embedded in it. 
2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is 
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge. 
‘Thomson’s model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains 
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive 
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal 
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.The coloured area 
contains all the 
positive charge 
in the atom 
The negatively 
charged electrons are spread 
throughout the positive charge

Thomsor's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded 
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We 
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part 
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds 
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson’s model of EzdERE 
- m?s[udygear 
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the 
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s 
experiments. 
Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus 
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as a.-particles). Alpha particle 
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually 
a helium ion, He**. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium. 
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through 
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin 
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will 
now describe Rutherfords experiment.

which led to the discovery of nucleus. 
Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus 
After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these 
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons 
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery 
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.When fast moving alpha particles are allowed to strike a very thin gold foil in vacuum, it is found 
that: 
1. Most of the alpha particles pass 
straight through the gold foil 
without any deflection from their 
original path (see Figure 13).

deflected. Since most of the alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil 7 
without any deflection, it shows that there is a lot of empty space in the atom. mYstudygear 
We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body 
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha 
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre 
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles 
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as 
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively 
charged nucleus in the atom. 
A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained 
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by 
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles 
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which 
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the 
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected 
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of 
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than 
the radius of the atom. 
From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment 
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about 
the nucleus of an atom: 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged. 2 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard. 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.Nucleus 
The nucleus is a small positively charged 
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus 
contains all the protons and neutrons, 
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons, 
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible 
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due 
to the presence of protons in it. The number of 
protons in the nucleus determines the number 
ofpositive charges on th.e nucleus. The neutrons Figure14. The nucleus of an atom is extremely small as 
which are also present in the nucleus have no compared to the size of the atom as a whole. The relative 
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons size of the nucleus in an atom is roughly the same as that 
taken together are known as nucleons (because of a pea in the middle of this large stadium. 
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of rnvstudygear 
the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear 
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown 
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford. [Ezsm 
=% Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in 
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom. 
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom 
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s 
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this 
improved model of atom now. 
THERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom. 
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows: 
1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons 
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the 
entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the 
nucleus.

electrons holds the atom together. 
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom 
is equal. 
5. Most of the atom is empty space. 
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom. 
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to 
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron 
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen 
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note 
that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus 
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure 
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it 
is electrically neutral. 
Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom 
A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the 
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion. 
In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the 
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path, 
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around 
the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively 
charged 
electron According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a 
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must 
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this 
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will 
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the 
nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously 
by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease 
gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons Positively charged nucleus 
will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how 
nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the an energy losing electron could fall 
nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus. 
- SomcairtiinGesshemsty -by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence 
the atom should collapse. ac 
But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the ~ mYstudygear 
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own. ol 
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom. 
Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom 
In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of 
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr: 
1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy 
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount 
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits 
farther from the nucleus have higher energy. 
2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus, 
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around 
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they 
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or 
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy 
levels” or “electron shells”. 
BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described 
as follows: 
1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have 
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral. 
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on 
the whole is electrically neutral. 
2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to 
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged. 
3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels 
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 
4,5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted 
from the centre outwards. 
4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For 
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy 
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold 
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of 
32 electrons. 
5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest 
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the 
maximum energy. 
6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same 
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place 
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes downfrom a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps 
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a 
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

OMIC MBER 
We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number 
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define 
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is 
known as atomic number of that element. That is: (O] 
Atomic number = Number of protons 
of an element  in one atom of element 
For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium 
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6. 
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. 
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11, 
50 we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And 
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1. 
All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence 
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons 
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic 
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used 
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other 
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which 
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various 
elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of 
protons in them). 
In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in 
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in 
a neutral atom of that element. That is,Atomic number = Number of electrons 
of an element  in one neutral atom 
For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is 
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number 
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal 
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons 
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either 
less or more electrons than protons. 
Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a 
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change, 
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change 
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same. 
It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things: 
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element. 
2. 1t tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element. 
For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons. 
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number 
of an element. 
MASS NUMBER 
An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the 
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons 
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number 
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass 
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no 
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element 
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23. 
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen 
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken 
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one 
atom of an element is known as its mass number. 
The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows. 
We have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Now,  Mass of a proton =1u i 
And, Mass of a neutron =1u 
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1 
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons 
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so: 
Mass number = Atomic massThus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass 
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23, 
then its atomic mass will be 23 u. 
Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number 
We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We 
have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can 
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic 
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper 
left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below: 
Mass

Atomic 
number 
For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as: 
12, 
C 6 
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass 
number of carbon. Let us solve some problems now. 
I I SCIUSUEY Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass 
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element? 
BTt We know that: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12 
And, Atomic number =23 - 12 
=11 
The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If, 
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol 
becomes 2Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number. 
The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8. 
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom? 
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question) 
(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this 
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8. 
(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and 
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is, 
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero). i 
Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How 
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom. 
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number 
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus 
has been given to be 2. Now, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, 4 =2 + No. of neutrons 
And, No. of neutrons =4-2 
=2 
Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons. 
ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE MS 
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In 
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or 
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells 
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P. 
1st energy level is K shell 
2nd energy level is L shell 
3rd energy level is M shell 
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N) 
The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted 
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest 
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on. 
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level. 
‘We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a 
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy 
the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy 
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. 
Electronic Configurations of Elements 
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element 
is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the 
214 *distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell, 
etc. 
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things: 
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element. 
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different 
shells of the atom. 
The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element, 
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the 
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons. 
The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given 
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme: 
1. The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the 
atom is given by 2n% (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum 
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom. 
(i) For st energy level, n =1 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n? 5 
=2x (1) 
=2x1 
=2 
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n =2 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n? 
=i 
=2x4 
=8 
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n? 
. =12.% (3)2 
=2x9 
=18 
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n? 
(e 
=2x16 
=32 
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2, 
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now, 
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is 
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum 
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18 
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows: 
Electron shell Max capacity 
K shell 2 electrons 
L shell . ‘ 8 electrons 
M shell 18 electrons 
N shell 32 electrons2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the 
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first 
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons) 
This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only. 
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons 
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons 
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell 
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the 
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also 
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell 
(K shell) in its atom. 
3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely 
filled with electrons 
This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons 
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule 
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes. 
Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements. 
W Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12. 
Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has 
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a Solution. 
maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we 
K write 3 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L 
L 
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write s In this way 2 + 8 
= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons. 
M 
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write & for it. Writing all the 
electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes: 
KLM 
2,80 
Please note that it is not necessary to write 
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the 
electronic configurations of the elements. 
For example, the electronic configuration 
of the element X of atomic number 12 can 
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however, 
better to indicate their shells also. Another 
point to be noted is that we have given so 
many details in the solution of this problem 
just to make you understand the things 
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arra.ngement 
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23. Figure 23. Figure for sample 
problem 1.m Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon 
=6) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of carbon is 6, so a carbon atom has 6 electrons in it. Out 
of 6 electrons: K 
(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write 5 
(ii) the remaining 6 — 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ];. 
So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration 
of a carbon atom) will be: 
K L or Prghils 
254 
m Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium 
=11) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom 
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons 
will occupy K shell, the next § electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining 
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom 
will be: 
X LMl 8 8, 1 
ke el 
m What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion, 
Na+? What would be its atomic number? 
The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, 2 neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11 
electrons in it. 
(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron 
from a sodium atom. S0, 2 sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus, 
K 
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be L or 2, 8. 
> 
(if) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its 
atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number 
of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that 
of a sodium atom, which is 11. 
m Explain why, sodium jon, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
m A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of 
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the 
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium jon Na* 
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill 
up Kand L shells. 
m If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons 
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons. 
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2 + 8 = 10 
electrons in it. 
An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the 
element? 
There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means 
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell) 
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons, 
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has 
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2. 
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number 
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the 
atomic number of this element is 12. - y

Before we end this discussion, we would like to say a few words about the electronic configurations 
of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We 
Kknow that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy 
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This 
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further 
and discuss valence electrons (or valency electrons) please answer the following questions:

VALENCE ELECTRONS (OR VALENCY ELECTRONS) 
The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us . take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly. 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be 1 (— Valence electron 
Kl "M, 
5 oihe In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost 
shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron 
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium 
atom has 1 valence electron. «— Outermost shell 
(Valence shell) 
When a sodium atom combines with other atoms, 
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part 
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells 
(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part 
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron 
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure). 
We can now say that those electrons of an atom « 
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located 
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either 
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another 
atom. 
(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms. 
(if) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their 
atoms. 
(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write 
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell 
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence 
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example. 
What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having 
atomic number 172 Name the valence shell of this atom. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the 
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17, 
s0 one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be: 
KL M 
24857 
Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus, 
there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X. 
Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the 
elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with 
one another. This is discussed below.Inertness of Noble Gases 
There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium, 
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they 
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons 
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we 
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow 
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic 
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

3. Argon Ar 18 58 @ 8 
4. Krypton Kr o 8 
5. Xenon Xe s A 8 
6. . Rn g 18 o % 5 8 
If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we 
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have 
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can 
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold 
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost 
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells, 
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable 
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of 
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion 
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are 
very stable and hence chemically unreactive. 
Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of 
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in 
the atom. To have 2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is 
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here 
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons 
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and 
no other shells are present in the atom. 
It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements 
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely 
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble 
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost 
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases 
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gasesare monoatomic, that s, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same. 
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

electrons). All other noble gases have neon signs) because it glows when bulbs to prevent the tungsten

oxygen in air. 
Cause of Chemical Combination 
Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron 
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron 
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do 
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost 
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost 
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of 
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable. 
An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways: 
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom) 
(i) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom) 
(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom) 
If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons 
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged 
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations). 
If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts) 
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively 
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very 
high energy required). 
If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose 
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the 
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons 
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms. 
VALENCY OF ELEMENTS 
When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they 
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of 
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element 
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four 
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CH,. The valency of an element is also known as 
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element. 
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other 
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This 
is discussed below. 
Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons 
The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in 
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element 
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons 
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron 
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom 
Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7. 
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine 
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete 
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to 
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom 
There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is 
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element). 
Types of Valency 
There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the 
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known 
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds 
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of 
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first. 
1. ELECTROVALENCY 
In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons 
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration 
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have 
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative 
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear. 
(a) Valency of Sodium 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in 
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na*, having an inert gas 
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electronconfiguration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19 
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain 
these two cases yourself. 
(b) Valency of Magnesium 
The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons 
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium 
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses 
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is 
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number 
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself. 
(c) Valency of Aluminium 
The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons 
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, A%, 
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to 
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic 
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself. 
(d) Valency of Chlorine 
The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has 
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it nceds 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the 
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, I, having an inert gas electron arrangement 
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so 
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also 
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each 
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also 
have the valency of 1 (or 1-). 
(e) Valency of Oxygen 
The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has 
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom 
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, 0%, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. 
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, 
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is 
also 2. Explain it yourself. 
(f) Valency of Nitrogen 
The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has 
5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. 
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N3-, having an inert gas electron 
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas 
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus 
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so 
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and 
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now. 
OVALENCY 
In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons 
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known 
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its 
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples. 
(a) Covalency of Hydrogen 
The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its 
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has 
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs 
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom 
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen  Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron oM @ hydrogen molecule (H-H or Hy). 
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of 
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share 
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of 
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining 
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration. 
(b) Covalency of Chlorine 
A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron 
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl,, each 
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1. 
(c) Covalency of Oxygen 
An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another 
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom 
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen 
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2. 
(d) Covalency of Nitrogen 
A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of 
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares 
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or 
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N, each nitrogen 
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.(e) Covalency of Carbon 
The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration 
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires 
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet’ It gets these electrons by 
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four 
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons 
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the 
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the 
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares 
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the 
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its mvstu dygear 
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself. g 
The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur, Bz 
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show 
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency 
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not 
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency. 
I Uil What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 127 
To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic 
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic

molecule (CH,). 
configuration will be . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M 
shell). So, one atom of tl"lis ’element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest 
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2 
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It 
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium). 
T ISPl What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 152 
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be 
;( ;‘ I;/[ It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to 
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element 
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency 
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus). 
I TS IS [f Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
The symbol Z stands for the atomic number of an element. By saying that 
Z = 3, we mean that the atomic number of this element is 3. The electronic 
configuration of the element having atomic number 3 is K L1t has 1 electron ’ g 
in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron 
to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement of ? (which is the same 
as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achievethe inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency is 1. The element 
having atomic number 3 is lithium. 
The number of valence electrons in a chloride ion, Cl-, are: 
(a) 16 (b) 8 (B)e17 (d) 18 
Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question) 
A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by 
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence 
electrons in a chloride ion (Cl-) willbe 7 + 1 = 8. 
ISOTOP 
In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’ 
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms 
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an 
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons). 
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons. 
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us 
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly. 
All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is 
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons. 
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has 
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as: 
wal and el 
Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers 
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below:

Figure 30. Diagrams of the two isotopes of chlorine. 
It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use 
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes 
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Pleasenote that the difference in the masses of 
isotopes of an element is due to the different 
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For 
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain 
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and 
hence they have different atomic masses of 
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear 
by now that whether we use the term “mass ” 2 
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition (a) ;7Cl contains 17 ®) 17 Cl contains 17 protons 
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another protusianc ® pevirons an R 
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear 
composition of isotopes in the examination, 
then we should give the number of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example, Figure 31. Nuclear composition of the two isotopes of 
chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls 
represent neutrons). 
(i) Nuclear composition of ;;Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons 
(ii) Nuclear composition of /Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons 
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers 
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example: 
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just 
Cl-35), and 
(if) 'The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just 
Cl-37). 
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon, 
oxygen and neon. 
1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number 
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be 
represented as: ‘ a 
RE S EIE tand e 
The three isotopes of hydrogen, JH,/H and ’H have been given the special names of protium, 
deuterium and tritium respectively. 
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as H 
Protium does not have a special symbol. 
(i) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as ;H. 
The special symbol of deuterium is D. 
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as *H . 
The special symbol of tritium is T. 
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium, 
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope 
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron; 
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of 
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as: 
i, Coand C These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal 
number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 =7 
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons. 
3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes:

All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers 
(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively. 
4, Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as: 
BNe, =Ne and ZNe 
It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number 
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will 
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. 
All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties 
The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons, 
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons 
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same). 
‘We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of 
their electronic configurations as follows. 
All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have 
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes 
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence 
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example, 
the two isotopes of chlorine, Cl and Cl, both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due 
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes ofchlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence 
electrons), they show identical chemical properties. 
The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different 
The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now; due to the presence 
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since 
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of 
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have 
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because 
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of 
chlorine, %Cl and ¥cl, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different 
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively. 
Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements 
The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not 
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u 
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of 
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different 
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope 
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the 
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most 
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two  Ejgyre 33. This flask contains 
isotopes fjc] and "Zc1 with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two 
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one types of atoms, one having a mass 
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 u in the ~ ©f35uandtheotherhavingamass 
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a g;?z a‘;g‘;?;g:i::{?:;:z;g;;r 
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This ) 
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will 
become more clear from the following discussion. 
(i) The chlorine isotope ol has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%. 
(i) The chlorine isotope €N has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%. 
This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine. So, 
75 25 Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35x— + 37x—

«d2925%,. 925. sdf¥E2 g, i 
100 100 
=26.25 +9.25 
=355u 
Thus, the average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u. 
All the naturally occurring isotopes of an element are present in a fixed proportion, so the average 
atomic mass of an element is fixed (or constant).‘We will now solve some problems based on isotopes. In order to find out whether two (or more) 
atoms are isotopes of the same element or not, we should look at the number of protons and neutrons 
in them. If they contain the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, they will be 
isotopes of the same element. The number of electrons in them will also be the same. This point will 
be helpful in solving the following problems. 
§ The number of protons, neutrons and electrons in species A to E are given in 
the following table: 
Neutrons Electrons 
6 4 
22 18 
20 17 
10 11 
18 17 
Indicate from the above table the species that represent a pair of isotopes. 
Those species which contain the same number of protons but different number 
of neutrons will be a pair of isotopes. In the above table only two species C and 
E have the same number of protons (17 each) but different number of neutrons 
(20 and 18 respectively). Thus, C and E are a pair of isotopes. (Please note that 
the atomic number 17 is of chlorine, so C and E are actually the two isotopes 
of chlorine). 
BRI ERYTINENeN Composition of the nuclei of two atomic species X and Y is given as under: 
X 
Protons : 6 6 
Neutrons: 6 8 
Give the mass numbers of X and Y. What is the relation between the two species 
and which element or elements they represent? (NCERT Book Question) 
MUITTOIE We know that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, Mass number of X=6+6 
=12 
Mass number of Y=6+8 
=14 
Thus, the mass number of X is 12 and that of Y is 14. 
Now; X contains 6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of X is 6. Y contains 
6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of Y is also 6. Since X and Y have the 
same atomic number (of 6) but different mass numbers (of 12 and 14), they 
are a pair of isotopes. Atomic number 6 is of carbon element. So, both X and 
Y represent carbon element.

___ sclnoetr s chomsty 2‘We know that upper digit in the symbol of an isotope represents its mass (which

Thus, the average atomic mass of bromine is 80 u. 
SETU NS A sample of an element X contains two isotopes eX and 's X . If the average 
atomic mass of this sample of the element be 16.2 u, calculate the percentage 
of the two isotopes in this sample. (NCERT Book Question) 
In order to solve this problem, we will have to suppose that the percentage of 
one of the isotopes in the sample is x, so that the percentage of the other isotope 
in the sample will be (100 - x). Now: 
(i) The mass of ‘; X isotope is 16 u. Suppose its percentage in the sample is x 
%. 
(i) The mass of X isotope is 18 u. Its percentage in the sample will be 
(100 - x) %. 
k o (100-x) 
So, Average atomic mass of X = 16x— 4+ 18 x 100 100 
But the average atomic mass of X has been given to be 16.2 u. Therefore, 
2% (100-x) = 16x— i 16.2 00 * 18 x T 
=1 o 5 16x+1800-18x 
100 
or 16.2 x 100 = 1800 - 2x 
or 2x = 1800 - 1620 
or 2x =180 
And x=180 
2 
or x =90 
: Thus, the percentage of the isotope X in the sample is 90%. The percentage 
of the other isotope '+ X in the sample will be 100 - 90 = 10%. 7 
2 koRADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES 
There are two types of isotopes: those which are stable and those which are unstable. The isotopes 
which are unstable (due to the presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei) and emit various types 
of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes (or just radioisotopes). The radiations (such as alpha 
particles, beta particles and gamma rays) are emitted by the unstable nuglei of the radioactive isotopes. 
Some of the common radioactive isotopes are: Carbon-14, Arsenic-74, Sodium-24, Iodine-131, Cobalt-60 
and Uranium-235. The high energy radiations emitted by radioactive isotopes are harmful to human 
beings. So, radioactive isotopes have to be used very, very carefully by taking suitable precautions and 
at proper concentrations to avoid damage. 
Applications of Radioactive Isotopes 
Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine to diagnose, study and treat various ailments. 
They are also used in power plants and in industry. Some of the important applications (or uses) of 
radioactive isotopes are given below. 
1. Radioactive isotopes are used as a fuel in nuclear reactors of nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
Uranium-235 isotope is used as a fuel in the reactors of nuclear power plants for generating 
electricity. This is done as follows: When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving 
neutrons, the heavy uranium nuclei break up to form two smaller nuclei and a tremendous amount of 
heat energy is produced. This heat energy is used to boil water in big boilers to form steam. The high 
pressure steam turns the turbines. The turbines run the generators to produce electricity. The process 
in which big uranium-235 nuclei are broken into smaller nuclei to obtain energy is called nuclear 
fission. The radioactive isotopes such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are also used for making 
atom bombs (or nuclear bombs). 
(a) Uranium-235 (b) A nuclear power plant 
Figure 34. Radioactive isotopes (such as uranium-235) are used as a fuel in the nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
2. Radioactive isotopes are used as ‘tracers’ in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and 
blood clots, etc., in the human body. 
A small amount of the low activity radioactive compound (called tracer) is either injected into the 
body of a person or given orally. This radioactive compound moves through the body and accumulates 
in the area of tumor, blood clot, etc. The exact position of the accumulated radioactive tracer can befound with the help of a device called Geiger counter. This gives the exact position of the tumor or 
blood clot and is of great help to the doctors for deciding further treatment. Arsenic-74 tracer is used 
to detect the presence of tumors and sodium-24 tracer is used to detect the presence of blood clots. 
3. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
Cobalt-60 radioisotope is used to cure cancer. When the high energy gamma radiations emitted 
by cobalt-60 radioisotopes are directed at the cancerous tumor in the human body, the cancerous cells 
get burnt. The treatment of cancer by using radioactive radiations is called radiotherapy. 
(a) This is cobalt-60 radioisotope. It produces (b) A carefully controlled beam of gamma rays s used to kill 
high energy gamma rays. cancer cells in the human body. It is called radiotherapy. 
Figure 35. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
4. Radioactive isotopes are used to determine the activity of thyroid gland which helps in the 
treatment of diseases like goitre. 
Doctors use iodine-131 radioisotope as a tracer 
to find how and at what rate the thyroid gland in our 
body takes up iodine (which is essential for making 
thyroxine hormone). This helps in the treatment of 
diseases like goitre. 
5. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry to 
detect the leakage in underground oil pipelines, 
gas pipelines and water pipes. 
To check the leakage in a metal pipeline, a  Figure 36. Radioactive isotopes being used for 
solution of the radioactive substance is introduced in  detectingleakagein underground pipeline carrying oil

radioactive solution will leak out, and the radioactive 
detector (called Geiger counter) will indicate a higher level of radiations. 
We have just studied isotopes which are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number 
but different mass numbers. It is, however, also possible that in some cases, the atoms of different 
elements having different atomic numbers may have the same mass number. Such atoms are called 
isobars. We can now say that: Isobars are the atoms of different elements having different atomic 
numbers but the same mass number (or same atomic mass). Isobars have different number of protons in their nuclei but the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in them is the same. An example

. . A . < 24 % 24 Here is another example of isobars. The radioactive sodium, ;,N@, and magnesium |, Mg, are 
isobars. This is because radioactive sodium and magnesium are different elements having different 
atomic numbers of 11 and 12 respectively but the same mass number of 24. 
In order to find out isobars from among a number of given species, we should look at their atomic 
numbers and mass numbers. The atomic species having different atomic numbers but same mass 
number will be isobars. We will now solve some problems based on isobars.

toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it

was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in
them which are called subatomic particles.

Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral.

Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge.

Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus.

Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons,
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together
to give the structure of atom.

(a) Combing the hair produces electric charge. (b) Electrically charged comb then attracts tiny pieces of paper.

The electric charge produced on the comb (on rubbing in hair) comes from the atoms present in the
comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).

Charged Particles in Matter

If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible.

DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON

The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons.

Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied,
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron
as follows.

Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish light in the above gas discharge
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream

of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of
negatively charged particles called electrons.

The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons

_ are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms

contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron
and minus sign for negative charge).
Characteristics of an Electron
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below.
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about [949 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which

is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass

of an electron is u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-78 gram. The mass of an

1
1840
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored
while calculating the atomic mass of an element.

2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb of negative
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative

charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one).

DISCOVERY OF PROTON

The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms
contain positively charged particles called protons.

The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses
and different charges.

Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus,
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of
an electron from a hydrogen atom.

Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas

charged subatomic particle called proton. The term — above picture) is produced when invisible anode

Rutherford who showed it to bea hydrogen nucleus. The anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas in the

Rutherford. called protons.
The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms.
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays.
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton
as follows.

The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p*
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge).

Characteristics of a Proton
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-74 gram.

2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron.
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one).

The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them.

DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON

After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So,
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units?
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932.
This particle is called neutron. The neutron isa neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom.
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n.

Characteristics of a Neutron

The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-*4 gram.

24 ERT
2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral.

We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now,

Atomic mass = Massof + Mass of
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons

6x1+6x1
12u

Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored.

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

Dalton’ atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible - which could not be broken down into
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below.

THOMSON’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom:

1, An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons
embedded in it.

2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge.

Thomson's model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.

Thomson's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson's model of mrte fe]
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s one
experiments.

Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as o.-particles). Alpha particle
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually
a helium ion, He?*. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium.
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will
now describe Rutherford’s experiment.

Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus

After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.

We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively
charged nucleus in the atom.

A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than
the radius of the atom.

From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about
the nucleus of an atom:

(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged.
(ii) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard.
(iii) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.
Nucleus

The nucleus is a small positively charged
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus
contains all the protons and neutrons,
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons,
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due
to the presence of protons in it. The number of
protons in the nucleus determines the number
of positive charges on the nucleus. The neutrons
which are also present in the nucleus have no
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons
taken together are known as nucleons (because
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of

ras dygear

the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford.

Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom.
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this
improved model of atom now.

RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom.
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows:

1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the
entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the
nucleus.

3. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and negatively charged
electrons holds the atom together.
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom
is equal.
5. Most of the atom is empty space.
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom.
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note

that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it
is electrically neutral.

Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom

A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion.

In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path,
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around

the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively

charged
electron

According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the

nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously Positively
pT 4 | charged

by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease nucleus

gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons

will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how

nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the anenergy losing electron could fall

nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus.
by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence
the atom should collapse. ac

But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the mY studygear
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own.
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom.

Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom

In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr:

1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits
farther from the nucleus have higher energy.

2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus,
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy
levels” or “electron shells”.

BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described
as follows:

1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral.
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on
the whole is electrically neutral.

2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged.

3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted
from the centre outwards.

4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of
32 electrons.

5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the
maximum energy.

6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes down
from a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

ATOMIC NUMBER :

We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is
known as atomic number of that element. That is:

Atomic number = Number of protons
of anelement in one atom of element

For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6.
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1.
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11,
so we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1.

All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various

-elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of
protons in them).

In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in
a neutral atom of that element. That is,
Atomic number = Number of electrons
of anelement in one neutral atom

For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either
less or more electrons than protons.

Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change,
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same.

It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things:
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element.
2. It tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element.

For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons.
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number
of an element.

MASS NUMBER

An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23.
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one
atom of an element is known as its mass number.

The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows.
We have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Now, Mass of a proton = 1 u
And, Mass of a neutron = lu
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so:
Mass number = Atomic mass
Thus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23,
then its atomic mass will be 23 u.

Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number

We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We
have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper

left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below:

Mass
number

Atomic | *
number

For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as:
ne
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass
number of carbon. Lct us solve some problems now.
Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element?
Nottscim We know that:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12
And, Atomic number = 23 - 12
=11

The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If,
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol
becomes °*Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number.

The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8.
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom?
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question)

(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8.

(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is,
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero).

Wiiyt@ucoetaiiem Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)
We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom.
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus
has been given to be 2. Now,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

So, 4 =2 +No. of neutrons
And, No.of neutrons =4-2
=

Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons.

ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE ATOMS
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P.

Ist energy level is K shell

2nd energy level is L shell
3rd energy level is M shell
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

M N<+—— Electron shells

First energy level
Second energy level

Fourth energy level —>

18 32 <«—— Maximum number of
electrons which can be
accommodated in the
various shells

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N)

The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on.
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level.

We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy

.the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on.

Electronic Configurations of Elements
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element

is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the
214 "Bilis bated baba es
distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell,
etc.
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things:
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element.
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different
shells of the atom.

The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element,
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons.

The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme:

1, The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the
atom is given by 2n? (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom.

(i) For 1st energy level, n = 1
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n?
= 2''(¥)
=2x1
=2
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n = 2
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n?
=2~x (2)?
=2x4
=8
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n?
. = 2 x (3)?
=2x9
= 18
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n?
= 2 x (4)?
=2x 16
= 32
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2,
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now,
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows:

Electron shell Maximum capacity

K shell 2 electrons
L shell 8 electrons
M shell 18 electrons
N shell 32 electrons
2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons)

This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only.
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell
(K shell) in its atom.

3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely
filled with electrons

This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes.

Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements.

Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12.

Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a

Sample Problem 1.

Solution.

maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we
K
write 5 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L

L
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write 3° In this way 2 + 8

= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons.

M
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write - for it. Writing all the

electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes:

KLM

2,852
Please note that it is not necessary to write
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the
electronic configurations of the elements.
For example, the electronic configuration
of the element X of atomic number 12 can
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however,
better to indicate their shells also. Another
point to be noted is that we have given so
many details in the solution of this problem
just to make you understand the things
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arrangement
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23.

F Sample Problem 2.) Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon
= 6) (NCERT Book Question)
| Solution.| The atomic number of carbon is 6, so a carbon atom has 6 electrons in it. Out

of 6 electrons:
K

(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write ied
L

(ii) the remaining 6 - 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ,-

So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration

of a carbon atom) will be:

Sample Problem 3.) Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium
= 11) (NCERT Book Question)

The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons
will occupy K shell, the next 8 electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom
will be:

F Sample Problem 4.) What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion,
Na‘? What would be its atomic number?

The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, a neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11

electrons in it.

(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron
from a sodium atom. So, a sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus,

KL
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be or 2, 8.

(ii) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its

atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number

- of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that
of a sodium atom, which is 4,

Sample Problem 5. Explain why, sodium ion, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells.
(NCERT Book Question)
F Solution.] A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium ion Na*
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill

up K and L shells.
F Sample Problem 6.] If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)
K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons.
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2+ 8=10
electrons in it.

An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the
element?

There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell)
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons,
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2.
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the
atomic number of this element is 12.

Before we end this discussion, we would like to say a few words about the electronic configurations
of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We
know that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,
the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further

)

The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the
outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they
decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part

in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us .

take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly.

The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.

223
So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be a Valence electron

Kel
a a In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost

shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium
atom has | valence electron.

Outermost shell
(Valence shell)

When a sodium atom combines with other atoms,
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells

(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure).

We can now say that those electrons of an atom
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another
atom.

(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms.

(ii) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their
atoms.

(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms.
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example.

What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having
atomic number 17? Name the valence shell of this atom.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17,
so one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be:

KLM
2BR7

Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus,
- there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X.

Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the

elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with
one another. This is discussed below.
Inertness of Noble Gases

There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium,
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells,
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are
very stable and hence chemically unreactive.

Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in
the atom. To have ‘2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and
no other shells are present in the atom.

It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gases
are monoatomic, that is, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same.
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

Cause of Chemical Combination

Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable.

An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways:
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom)

(ii) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom)

(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom)

If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations).

If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts)
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very
high energy required).

If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms.

VALENCY OF ELEMENTS

When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,

the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CHy. The valency of an element is also known as
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element.
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This
is discussed below.

Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons

The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom

Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7.
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom

There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element).

Types of Valency

There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first.

1. ELECTROVALENCY

In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear.

(a) Valency of Sodium

The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na’, having an inert gas
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain
these two cases yourself.

(b) Valency of Magnesium

The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself.

(c) Valency of Aluminium

The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, Al**,
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.

(d) Valency of Chlorine

The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, CI’, having an inert gas electron arrangement
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also
have the valency of 1 (or 1-).

(e) Valency of Oxygen

The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, O?-, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8.
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement,
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is
also 2. Explain it yourself.

(f) Valency of Nitrogen

The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has
- 5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure.
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N°>-, having an inert gas electron
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.
The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now.

2. COVALENCY

In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples.

(a) Covalency of Hydrogen

The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration.

Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear
to form a hydrogen molecule (H-H or H,).

(b) Covalency of Chlorine

A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl, each
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1.

(c) Covalency of Oxygen

An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2.

(d) Covalency of Nitrogen

A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N>, each nitrogen
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.
(e) Covalency of Carbon

The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet. It gets these electrons by
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares Figure 29. Model of methane
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the ne cae (Gris:
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its i¥etis dygear
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself.

The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur,
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency.

iiiacoutnee What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 12?

To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic

configuration will be aes . . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M

shell). So, one atom of this ‘element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium).

Siietaeciecnwes What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 15?
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be

= : = It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus).

If Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element.
(NCERT Book Question)

The symbol Z stands for the atomic number of an element. By saying that
Z = 3, we mean that the atomic number of this element is 3. The electronic

Sample Problem 3.

configuration of the element having atomic number 3 is It has 1 electron

>
in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron
to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement of . (which is the same
as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achieve
230

the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency is 1. The element
having atomic number 3 is lithium.

The number of valence electrons in a chloride ion, Cl-, are:
(a) 16 (b) 8 (c) 17 (d) 18
Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question)

A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence
electrons in a chloride ion (CI-) will be 7 + 1 = 8.

ISOTOPES

In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons).
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons.
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly.

All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons.
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as:

vcl and Tat

Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below:

Figure 30. Diagrams of the two isotopes of chlorine.
It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Please
note that the difference in the masses of
isotopes of an element is due to the different
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and
hence they have different atomic masses of
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear
by now that whether we use the term “mass
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear
composition of isotopes in the examination,
then we should give the number of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example,

(i) Nuclear composition of Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons

35 : 37
(a) ;,Cl contains 17 (b) 7 Cl contains 17 protons
protons and 18 neutrons and 20 neutrons

chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls
represent neutrons).

(ii) Nuclear composition of “Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example:
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just
Cl-35), and
(ii) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just
Cl-37).
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon,
oxygen and neon.
1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be
represented as:

ft, pe et

The three isotopes of hydrogen, iH,7H and +H have been given the special names of protium,
deuterium and tritium respectively.
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as iH

Protium does not have a special symbol.
(ii) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as {H.

The special symbol of deuterium is D.
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as 7H.

The special symbol of tritium is T.
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium,
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

Name Isotope Protons Neutrons Electrons
Protium iH 1 0 1
Deuterium TH 1 1 1
Tritium 7H 1 2 1
It is clear from the above table that all the isotopes of hydrogen contain 1 proton and | electron
each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron;
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as:

Bae 2c ands..1C
These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal

number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 = 7
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons.

3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes:
) vieeryO and. UO

8
All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers

(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively.
4. Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as:

20. 21 22
Ne, jgNe and jNe

It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties.

All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties

The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons,
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same).
We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of
their electronic configurations as follows.

All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example,
the two isotopes of chlorine, ur and wee , both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes of
chlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence
electrons), they show identical chemical properties.

The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different

The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now, due to the presence
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of
chlorine, *c] and *’c}, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively.

Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements

The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two _ Figure 33. This flask contains
isotopes tl and wi with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one _ types of atoms, one having a mass
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 uin the — f35 uand the other having amass
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a sat atthe ree teamin
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will
become more clear from the following discussion.

(i) The chlorine isotope *°c| has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%.

(ii) The chlorine isotope 7Cl has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%.

This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass

of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass
of chlorine. So,

Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35 eta + 37x bes
100 100
a a
100 100
= 26.25 + 9.25
=35.5u

Thus, the average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u.

All the naturally occurring isotopes of an element are present in a fixed proportion, so the average
atomic mass of an element is fixed (or constant).
We will now solve some problems based on isotopes. In order to find out whether two (or more)
atoms are isotopes of the same element or not, we should look at the number of protons and neutrons
in them. If they contain the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, they will be
isotopes of the same element. The number of electrons in them will also be the same. This point will
be helpful in solving the following problems.

Sine cewcy(anm@e Ihe number of protons, neutrons and electrons in species A to E are given in
the following table:

Species Protons Neutrons Electrons
2 ik. tees 4
ee 22 18
= 17 20 17
Ba ee 10 11
E ee rns 17

Indicate from the above table the species that represent a pair of isotopes.

Those species which contain the same number of protons but different number
of neutrons will be a pair of isotopes. In the above table only two species C and
E have the same number of protons (17 each) but different number of neutrons
(20 and 18 respectively). Thus, C and E are a pair of isotopes. (Please note that
the atomic number 17 is of chlorine, so C and E are actually the two isotopes

of chlorine).

Give the mass numbers of X and Y. What is the relation between the two species
and which element or elements they represent? (NCERT Book Question)

Nroitiecim We know that:
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
So, Mass number of X=6+6
= {2
Mass number of Y=6+8
= 14
Thus, the mass number of X is 12 and that of Y is 14.
Now, X contains 6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of X is 6. Y contains
6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of Y is also 6. Since X and Y have the
same atomic number (of 6) but different mass numbers (of 12 and 14), they

are a pair of isotopes. Atomic number 6 is of carbon element. So, both X and
Y represent carbon element.

If the abundance of {Br isotope is 49.7% and that of $! Br isotope is 50.3%,
calculate the average atomic mass of bromine. (NCERT Book Question)
We know that upper digit in the symbol of an isotope represents its mass (which
is the same as its mass number). Now:
(i) The mass of 7? Br isotope is 79 u and its abundance is 49.7%.
(ii) The mass of 3;Br isotope is 81 u and its abundance is 50.3%.

Thus, the average atomic mass of bromine is 80 u.

A sample of an element X contains two isotopes Xx and * X . If the average
atomic mass of this sample of the element be 16.2 u, calculate the percentage
of the two isotopes in this sample. (NCERT Book Question)

In order to solve this problem, we will have to suppose that the percentage of
one of the isotopes in the sample is x, so that the percentage of the other isotope
in the sample will be (100 - x). Now:

So, Average atomic mass of bromine

(i) The mass of pes isotope is 16 u. Suppose its percentage in the sample is x

, x (100-x)
So, Average atomic mass of X = 16x—— .+.18x

But the average atomic mass of X has been given to be 16.2 u. Therefore,

of the other isotope |, X in the sample will be 100 - 90 = 10%.

RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES

There are two types of isotopes: those which are stable and those which are unstable. The isotopes
which are unstable (due to the presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei) and emit various types
of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes (or just radioisotopes). The radiations (such as alpha
particles, beta particles and gamma rays) are emitted by the unstable nuclei of the radioactive isotopes.
Some of the common radioactive isotopes are: Carbon-14, Arsenic-74, Sodium-24, Iodine-131, Cobalt-60
and Uranium-235. The high energy radiations emitted by radioactive isotopes are harmful to human
beings. So, radioactive isotopes have to be used very, very carefully by taking suitable precautions and
at proper concentrations to avoid damage.

Applications of Radioactive Isotopes

Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine to diagnose, study and treat various ailments.
They are also used in power plants and in industry. Some of the important applications (or uses) of
radioactive isotopes are given below.

1. Radioactive isotopes are used as a fuel in nuclear reactors of nuclear power plants for
generating electricity.

Uranium-235 isotope is used as a fuel in the reactors of nuclear power plants for generating
electricity. This is done as follows: When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving
neutrons, the heavy uranium nuclei break up to form two smaller nuclei and a tremendous amount of
heat energy is produced. This heat energy is used to boil water in big boilers to form steam. The high
pressure steam turns the turbines. The turbines run the generators to produce electricity. The process
in which big uranium-235 nuclei are broken into smaller nuclei to obtain energy is called nuclear
fission.The radioactive isotopes such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are also used for making
atom bombs (or nuclear bombs).

Figure 34. Radioactive isotopes (such as uranium-235) are used as a fuel in the nuclear power plants for
generating electricity.

2. Radioactive isotopes are used as ‘tracers’ in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and
blood clots, etc., in the human body.

A small amount of the low activity radioactive compound (called tracer) is either injected into the
body of a person or given orally. This radioactive compound moves through the body and accumulates
in the area of tumor, blood clot, etc. The exact position of the accumulated radioactive tracer can be
found with the help of a device called Geiger counter. This gives the exact position of the tumor or
blood clot and is of great help to the doctors for deciding further treatment. Arsenic-74 tracer is used
to detect the presence of tumors and sodium-24 tracer is used to detect the presence of blood clots.

3. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer.

Cobalt-60 radioisotope is used to cure cancer. When the high energy gamma radiations emitted
by cobalt-60 radioisotopes are directed at the cancerous tumor in the human body, the cancerous cells
get burnt. The treatment of cancer by using radioactive radiations is called radiotherapy.

(a) This is cobalt-60 radioisotope. It produces (b) Acarefully controlled beam of gamma rays is used to kill
high energy gamma rays. cancer cells in the human body. It is called radiotherapy.

Figure 35. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer.

4. Radioactive isotopes are used to determine the activity of thyroid gland which helps in the
treatment of diseases like goitre.

Doctors use iodine-131 radioisotope as a tracer
to find how and at what rate the thyroid gland in our
body takes up iodine (which is essential for making
thyroxine hormone). This helps in the treatment of
diseases like goitre.

5. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry to
detect the leakage in underground oil pipelines,
gas pipelines and water pipes.

To check the leakage in a metal pipeline, a Figure 36. Radioactive isotopes being used for
solution of the radioactive substance is introduced in _ detecting leakage in underground pipeline carrying oil

radioactive solution will leak out, and the radioactive
detector (called Geiger counter) will indicate a higher level of radiations.

We have just studied isotopes which are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number
but different mass numbers. It is, however, also possible that in some cases, the atoms of different
elements having different atomic numbers may have the same mass number. Such atoms are called
isobars. We can now say that: Isobars are the atoms of different elements having different atomic
numbers but the same mass number (or same atomic mass). Isobars have different number of protons

in their nuclei but the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in them is the same. An example
: : 40 , oe . '
of isobars is argon, ,, Ar , and calcium, - Ca. This is because argon and calcium are atoms of different

elements having different atomic numbers of 18 and 20 respectively but the same mass number of 40.

The complete nuclear composition of the isobars on Ar and i Ca. is given below: y

Here is another example of isobars. The radioactive sodium, ,,;Na@, and magnesium |, Mg, are

isobars. This is because radioactive sodium and magnesium are different elements having different
atomic numbers of 11 and 12 respectively but the same mass number of 24.

In order to find out isobars from among a number of given species, we should look at their atomic
numbers and mass numbers. The atomic species having different atomic numbers but same mass
number will be isobars. We will now solve some problems based on isobars.

244 Structure of Atom


STRUCTURE 
OF ATOM 
around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it 
was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now 
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in 
them which are called subatomic particles. 
Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has 
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral. 
Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire 
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very 
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge. 
Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus 
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral 
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus 
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. 
Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons, 
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not 
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and 
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together 
to give the structure of atom. ’- toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

(a) Combing the hair produces electric charge. (b) Electrically charged comb then attracts tiny pieces of paper. 
Figure 1.The electric charge produced on the comb (on rubbing in hair) comes from the atoms present in the 
comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).Charged Particles in Matter 
If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass 
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the 
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that 
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod 
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The 
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments 
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible. 
DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON 
The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed 
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of 
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called 
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does 
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively 
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all 
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons. 
Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge 
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied, 
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving 
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic 
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron 
as follows. 
Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish lightin the above gas discharge 
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike 
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream 
of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of 
negatively charged particles called electrons. 
The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons 
are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms 
contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron 
and minus sign for negative charge).Characteristics of an Electron 
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about 7277 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which 
is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass 
1 
of an electron is @ u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-28 gram. The mass of an 
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored 
while calculating the atomic mass of an element. 
2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb of negative 
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-1° coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any 
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative 
charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one). 
DISCOVERY OF PROTON 
The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles 
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles 
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms 
contain positively charged particles called protons. 
The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When 
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge 
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of 
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge 
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases 
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses 
and different charges. 
Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles 
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from 
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus, 
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of 
an electron from a hydrogen atom. 
Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas 
sometimes credited with the discovery of positively  discharge tube (seen on the extreme left side in the 
charged subatomic particle called proton. The term above picture) is produced when invisible anode

So, the discoverer of proton is generally said tobe Ernest  discharge tube consist of positively charged particles 
Rutherford. called protons.The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms. 
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons 
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a 
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays. 
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest 
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively 
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton 
as follows. 
The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons 
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms 
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p* 
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge). 
Characteristics of a Proton 
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since 
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a 
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is 
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton 
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-# gram. 
2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron. 
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-° coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb 
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit 
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative 
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one). 
The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low 
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation 
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the 
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them. 
DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON 
After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot 
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom 
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So, 
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong 
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units? 
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932. 
This particle is called neutron. The neutron is a neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom. 
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain 
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen 
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n. 
Characteristics of a Neutron 
The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the 
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-2 gram. 
208 : D el L2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral. 
We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon 
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6 
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now, 
Atomic mass = Mass of + Mass of 
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons 
6x1+6x1 
12u 
Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons 
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored. Figure 6. James Chadwick:

STRUCTURE OF ATOM 
Dalton's atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible — which could not be broken down into 
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom 
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that 
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons 
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom 
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson 
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below. 
THOMSON'’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were 
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom: 
1. An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons 
embedded in it. 
2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is 
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge. 
‘Thomson’s model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains 
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive 
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal 
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.The coloured area 
contains all the 
positive charge 
in the atom 
The negatively 
charged electrons are spread 
throughout the positive charge

Thomsor's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded 
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We 
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part 
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds 
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson’s model of EzdERE 
- m?s[udygear 
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the 
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s 
experiments. 
Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus 
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as a.-particles). Alpha particle 
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually 
a helium ion, He**. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium. 
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through 
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin 
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will 
now describe Rutherfords experiment.

which led to the discovery of nucleus. 
Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus 
After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these 
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons 
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery 
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.When fast moving alpha particles are allowed to strike a very thin gold foil in vacuum, it is found 
that: 
1. Most of the alpha particles pass 
straight through the gold foil 
without any deflection from their 
original path (see Figure 13).

deflected. Since most of the alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil 7 
without any deflection, it shows that there is a lot of empty space in the atom. mYstudygear 
We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body 
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha 
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre 
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles 
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as 
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively 
charged nucleus in the atom. 
A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained 
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by 
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles 
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which 
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the 
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected 
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of 
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than 
the radius of the atom. 
From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment 
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about 
the nucleus of an atom: 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged. 2 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard. 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.Nucleus 
The nucleus is a small positively charged 
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus 
contains all the protons and neutrons, 
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons, 
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible 
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due 
to the presence of protons in it. The number of 
protons in the nucleus determines the number 
ofpositive charges on th.e nucleus. The neutrons Figure14. The nucleus of an atom is extremely small as 
which are also present in the nucleus have no compared to the size of the atom as a whole. The relative 
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons size of the nucleus in an atom is roughly the same as that 
taken together are known as nucleons (because of a pea in the middle of this large stadium. 
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of rnvstudygear 
the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear 
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown 
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford. [Ezsm 
=% Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in 
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom. 
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom 
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s 
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this 
improved model of atom now. 
THERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom. 
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows: 
1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons 
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the 
entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the 
nucleus.

electrons holds the atom together. 
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom 
is equal. 
5. Most of the atom is empty space. 
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom. 
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to 
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron 
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen 
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note 
that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus 
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure 
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it 
is electrically neutral. 
Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom 
A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the 
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion. 
In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the 
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path, 
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around 
the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively 
charged 
electron According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a 
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must 
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this 
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will 
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the 
nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously 
by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease 
gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons Positively charged nucleus 
will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how 
nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the an energy losing electron could fall 
nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus. 
- SomcairtiinGesshemsty -by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence 
the atom should collapse. ac 
But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the ~ mYstudygear 
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own. ol 
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom. 
Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom 
In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of 
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr: 
1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy 
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount 
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits 
farther from the nucleus have higher energy. 
2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus, 
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around 
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they 
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or 
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy 
levels” or “electron shells”. 
BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described 
as follows: 
1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have 
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral. 
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on 
the whole is electrically neutral. 
2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to 
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged. 
3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels 
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 
4,5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted 
from the centre outwards. 
4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For 
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy 
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold 
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of 
32 electrons. 
5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest 
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the 
maximum energy. 
6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same 
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place 
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes downfrom a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps 
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a 
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

OMIC MBER 
We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number 
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define 
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is 
known as atomic number of that element. That is: (O] 
Atomic number = Number of protons 
of an element  in one atom of element 
For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium 
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6. 
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. 
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11, 
50 we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And 
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1. 
All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence 
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons 
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic 
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used 
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other 
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which 
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various 
elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of 
protons in them). 
In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in 
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in 
a neutral atom of that element. That is,Atomic number = Number of electrons 
of an element  in one neutral atom 
For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is 
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number 
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal 
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons 
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either 
less or more electrons than protons. 
Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a 
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change, 
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change 
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same. 
It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things: 
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element. 
2. 1t tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element. 
For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons. 
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number 
of an element. 
MASS NUMBER 
An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the 
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons 
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number 
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass 
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no 
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element 
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23. 
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen 
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken 
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one 
atom of an element is known as its mass number. 
The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows. 
We have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Now,  Mass of a proton =1u i 
And, Mass of a neutron =1u 
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1 
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons 
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so: 
Mass number = Atomic massThus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass 
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23, 
then its atomic mass will be 23 u. 
Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number 
We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We 
have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can 
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic 
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper 
left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below: 
Mass 
number 
Atomic 
number 
For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as: 
12, 
C 6 
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass 
number of carbon. Let us solve some problems now. 
I I SCIUSUEY Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass 
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element? 
BTt We know that: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12 
And, Atomic number =23 - 12 
=11 
The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If, 
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol 
becomes 2Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number. 
The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8. 
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom? 
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question) 
(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this 
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8. 
(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and 
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is, 
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero). i 
Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How 
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom. 
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number 
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus 
has been given to be 2. Now, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, 4 =2 + No. of neutrons 
And, No. of neutrons =4-2 
=2 
Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons. 
ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE MS 
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In 
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or 
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells 
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P. 
1st energy level is K shell 
2nd energy level is L shell 
3rd energy level is M shell 
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N) 
The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted 
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest 
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on. 
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level. 
‘We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a 
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy 
the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy 
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. 
Electronic Configurations of Elements 
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element 
is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the 
214 *distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell, 
etc. 
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things: 
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element. 
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different 
shells of the atom. 
The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element, 
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the 
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons. 
The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given 
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme: 
1. The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the 
atom is given by 2n% (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum 
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom. 
(i) For st energy level, n =1 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n? 5 
=2x (1) 
=2x1 
=2 
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n =2 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n? 
=i 
=2x4 
=8 
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n? 
. =12.% (3)2 
=2x9 
=18 
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n? 
(e 
=2x16 
=32 
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2, 
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now, 
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is 
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum 
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18 
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows: 
Electron shell Max capacity 
K shell 2 electrons 
L shell . ‘ 8 electrons 
M shell 18 electrons 
N shell 32 electrons2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the 
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first 
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons) 
This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only. 
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons 
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons 
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell 
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the 
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also 
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell 
(K shell) in its atom. 
3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely 
filled with electrons 
This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons 
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule 
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes. 
Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements. 
W Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12. 
Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has 
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a Solution. 
maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we 
K write 3 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L 
L 
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write s In this way 2 + 8 
= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons. 
M 
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write & for it. Writing all the 
electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes: 
KLM 
2,80 
Please note that it is not necessary to write 
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the 
electronic configurations of the elements. 
For example, the electronic configuration 
of the element X of atomic number 12 can 
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however, 
better to indicate their shells also. Another 
point to be noted is that we have given so 
many details in the solution of this problem 
just to make you understand the things 
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arra.ngement 
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23. Figure 23. Figure for sample 
problem 1.m Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon 
=6) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of carbon is 6, so a carbon atom has 6 electrons in it. Out 
of 6 electrons: K 
(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write 5 
(ii) the remaining 6 — 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ];. 
So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration 
of a carbon atom) will be: 
K L or Prghils 
254 
m Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium 
=11) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom 
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons 
will occupy K shell, the next § electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining 
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom 
will be: 
X LMl 8 8, 1 
ke el 
m What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion, 
Na+? What would be its atomic number? 
The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, 2 neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11 
electrons in it. 
(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron 
from a sodium atom. S0, 2 sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus, 
K 
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be L or 2, 8. 
> 
(if) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its 
atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number 
of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that 
of a sodium atom, which is 11. 
m Explain why, sodium jon, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
m A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of 
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the 
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium jon Na* 
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill 
up Kand L shells. 
m If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons 
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons. 
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2 + 8 = 10 
electrons in it. 
An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the 
element? 
There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means 
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell) 
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons, 
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has 
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2. 
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number 
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the 
atomic number of this element is 12. - y

Before we end this discussion, we would like to say a few words about the electronic configurations 
of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We 
Kknow that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy 
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This 
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further 
and discuss valence electrons (or valency electrons) please answer the following questions:

VALENCE ELECTRONS (OR VALENCY ELECTRONS) 
The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us . take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly. 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be 1 (— Valence electron 
Kl "M, 
5 oihe In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost 
shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron 
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium 
atom has 1 valence electron. «— Outermost shell 
(Valence shell) 
When a sodium atom combines with other atoms, 
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part 
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells 
(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part 
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron 
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure). 
We can now say that those electrons of an atom « 
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located 
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either 
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another 
atom. 
(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms. 
(if) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their 
atoms. 
(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write 
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell 
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence 
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example. 
What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having 
atomic number 172 Name the valence shell of this atom. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the 
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17, 
s0 one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be: 
KL M 
24857 
Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus, 
there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X. 
Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the 
elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with 
one another. This is discussed below.Inertness of Noble Gases 
There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium, 
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they 
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons 
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we 
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow 
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic 
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

3. Argon Ar 18 58 @ 8 
4. Krypton Kr o 8 
5. Xenon Xe s A 8 
6. . Rn g 18 o % 5 8 
If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we 
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have 
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can 
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold 
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost 
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells, 
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable 
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of 
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion 
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are 
very stable and hence chemically unreactive. 
Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of 
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in 
the atom. To have 2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is 
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here 
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons 
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and 
no other shells are present in the atom. 
It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements 
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely 
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble 
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost 
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases 
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gasesare monoatomic, that s, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same. 
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

electrons). All other noble gases have neon signs) because it glows when bulbs to prevent the tungsten

oxygen in air. 
Cause of Chemical Combination 
Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron 
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron 
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do 
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost 
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost 
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of 
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable. 
An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways: 
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom) 
(i) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom) 
(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom) 
If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons 
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged 
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations). 
If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts) 
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively 
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very 
high energy required). 
If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose 
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the 
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons 
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms. 
VALENCY OF ELEMENTS 
When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they 
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of 
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element 
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four 
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CH,. The valency of an element is also known as 
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element. 
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other 
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This 
is discussed below. 
Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons 
The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in 
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element 
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons 
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron 
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom 
Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7. 
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine 
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete 
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to 
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom 
There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is 
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element). 
Types of Valency 
There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the 
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known 
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds 
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of 
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first. 
1. ELECTROVALENCY 
In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons 
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration 
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have 
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative 
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear. 
(a) Valency of Sodium 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in 
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na*, having an inert gas 
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electronconfiguration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19 
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain 
these two cases yourself. 
(b) Valency of Magnesium 
The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons 
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium 
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses 
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is 
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number 
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself. 
(c) Valency of Aluminium 
The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons 
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, A%, 
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to 
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic 
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself. 
(d) Valency of Chlorine 
The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has 
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it nceds 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the 
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, I, having an inert gas electron arrangement 
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so 
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also 
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each 
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also 
have the valency of 1 (or 1-). 
(e) Valency of Oxygen 
The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has 
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom 
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, 0%, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. 
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, 
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is 
also 2. Explain it yourself. 
(f) Valency of Nitrogen 
The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has 
5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. 
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N3-, having an inert gas electron 
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas 
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus 
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so 
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and 
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now. 
OVALENCY 
In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons 
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known 
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its 
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples. 
(a) Covalency of Hydrogen 
The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its 
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has 
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs 
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom 
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen  Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron oM @ hydrogen molecule (H-H or Hy). 
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of 
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share 
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of 
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining 
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration. 
(b) Covalency of Chlorine 
A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron 
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl,, each 
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1. 
(c) Covalency of Oxygen 
An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another 
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom 
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen 
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2. 
(d) Covalency of Nitrogen 
A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of 
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares 
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or 
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N, each nitrogen 
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.(e) Covalency of Carbon 
The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration 
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires 
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet’ It gets these electrons by 
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four 
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons 
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the 
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the 
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares 
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the 
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its mvstu dygear 
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself. g 
The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur, Bz 
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show 
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency 
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not 
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency. 
I Uil What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 127 
To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic 
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic 
KLM Figure 29. Model of methane 
molecule (CH,). 
configuration will be . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M 
shell). So, one atom of tl"lis ’element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest 
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2 
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It 
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium). 
T ISPl What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 152 
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be 
;( ;‘ I;/[ It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to 
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element 
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency 
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus). 
I TS IS [f Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
The symbol Z stands for the atomic number of an element. By saying that 
Z = 3, we mean that the atomic number of this element is 3. The electronic 
configuration of the element having atomic number 3 is K L1t has 1 electron ’ g 
in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron 
to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement of ? (which is the same 
as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achievethe inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency is 1. The element 
having atomic number 3 is lithium. 
The number of valence electrons in a chloride ion, Cl-, are: 
(a) 16 (b) 8 (B)e17 (d) 18 
Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question) 
A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by 
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence 
electrons in a chloride ion (Cl-) willbe 7 + 1 = 8. 
ISOTOP 
In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’ 
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms 
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an 
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons). 
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons. 
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us 
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly. 
All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is 
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons. 
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has 
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as: 
wal and el 
Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers 
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below: 
ILsotope Protons Neutrons Electrons

The diagrams of the two isotopes of chlorine are given below:

(Mass number or Atomic mass = 35) (Mass number or Atomic mass = 37) 
Figure 30. Diagrams of the two isotopes of chlorine. 
It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use 
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes 
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Pleasenote that the difference in the masses of 
isotopes of an element is due to the different 
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For 
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain 
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and 
hence they have different atomic masses of 
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear 
by now that whether we use the term “mass ” 2 
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition (a) ;7Cl contains 17 ®) 17 Cl contains 17 protons 
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another protusianc ® pevirons an R 
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear 
composition of isotopes in the examination, 
then we should give the number of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example, Figure 31. Nuclear composition of the two isotopes of 
chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls 
represent neutrons). 
(i) Nuclear composition of ;;Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons 
(ii) Nuclear composition of /Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons 
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers 
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example: 
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just 
Cl-35), and 
(if) 'The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just 
Cl-37). 
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon,

1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number 
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be 
represented as: ‘ a 
RE S EIE tand e 
The three isotopes of hydrogen, JH,/H and ’H have been given the special names of protium, 
deuterium and tritium respectively. 
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as H 
Protium does not have a special symbol. 
(i) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as ;H. 
The special symbol of deuterium is D. 
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as *H . 
The special symbol of tritium is T. 
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium, 
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope 
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron; 
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of 
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as: 
i, Coand C These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal 
number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 =7 
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons. 
3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes: 
Qaagk0 and . O 
All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers 
(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively. 
4, Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as: 
BNe, =Ne and ZNe 
It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number 
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will 
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. 
All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties 
The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons, 
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons 
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same). 
‘We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of 
their electronic configurations as follows. 
All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have 
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes 
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence 
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example, 
the two isotopes of chlorine, Cl and Cl, both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due 
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes ofchlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence 
electrons), they show identical chemical properties. 
The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different 
The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now; due to the presence 
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since 
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of 
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have 
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because 
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of 
chlorine, %Cl and ¥cl, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different 
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively. 
Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements 
The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not 
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u 
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of 
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different 
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope 
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the 
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most 
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two  Ejgyre 33. This flask contains 
isotopes fjc] and "Zc1 with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two 
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one types of atoms, one having a mass 
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 u in the ~ ©f35uandtheotherhavingamass 
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a g;?z a‘;g‘;?;g:i::{?:;:z;g;;r 
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This ) 
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will 
become more clear from the following discussion. 
(i) The chlorine isotope ol has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%. 
(i) The chlorine isotope €N has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%. 
This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine. So, 
75 25 Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35x— + 37x—

«d2925%,. 925. sdf¥E2 g, i 
100 100 
=26.25 +9.25 
=355u 
Thus, the average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u. 
All the naturally occurring isotopes of an element are present in a fixed proportion, so the average 
atomic mass of an element is fixed (or constant).‘We will now solve some problems based on isotopes. In order to find out whether two (or more) 
atoms are isotopes of the same element or not, we should look at the number of protons and neutrons 
in them. If they contain the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, they will be 
isotopes of the same element. The number of electrons in them will also be the same. This point will 
be helpful in solving the following problems. 
§ The number of protons, neutrons and electrons in species A to E are given in 
the following table: 
Neutrons Electrons 
6 4 
22 18 
20 17 
10 11 
18 17 
Indicate from the above table the species that represent a pair of isotopes. 
Those species which contain the same number of protons but different number 
of neutrons will be a pair of isotopes. In the above table only two species C and 
E have the same number of protons (17 each) but different number of neutrons 
(20 and 18 respectively). Thus, C and E are a pair of isotopes. (Please note that 
the atomic number 17 is of chlorine, so C and E are actually the two isotopes 
of chlorine). 
BRI ERYTINENeN Composition of the nuclei of two atomic species X and Y is given as under: 
X 
Protons : 6 6 
Neutrons: 6 8 
Give the mass numbers of X and Y. What is the relation between the two species 
and which element or elements they represent? (NCERT Book Question) 
MUITTOIE We know that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, Mass number of X=6+6 
=12 
Mass number of Y=6+8 
=14 
Thus, the mass number of X is 12 and that of Y is 14. 
Now; X contains 6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of X is 6. Y contains 
6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of Y is also 6. Since X and Y have the 
same atomic number (of 6) but different mass numbers (of 12 and 14), they 
are a pair of isotopes. Atomic number 6 is of carbon element. So, both X and 
Y represent carbon element. 
AR GOIIEVIREN Bromine occurs in nature mainly in the form of two isotopes 7; Br and §, Br. 
If the abundance of J;Br isotope is 49.7% and that of i Brisotope is 50.3%, 
calculate the average atomic mass of bromine. (NCERT Book Question) 
___ sclnoetr s chomsty 2‘We know that upper digit in the symbol of an isotope represents its mass (which 
is the same as its mass number). Now: 
(i) The mass of ;ZBr isotope is 79 u and its abundance is 49.7%. 
ii) The mass of 5 Br isotope is 81 u and its abundance is 50.3%. 3 i

Thus, the average atomic mass of bromine is 80 u. 
SETU NS A sample of an element X contains two isotopes eX and 's X . If the average 
atomic mass of this sample of the element be 16.2 u, calculate the percentage 
of the two isotopes in this sample. (NCERT Book Question) 
In order to solve this problem, we will have to suppose that the percentage of 
one of the isotopes in the sample is x, so that the percentage of the other isotope 
in the sample will be (100 - x). Now: 
(i) The mass of ‘; X isotope is 16 u. Suppose its percentage in the sample is x 
%. 
(i) The mass of X isotope is 18 u. Its percentage in the sample will be 
(100 - x) %. 
k o (100-x) 
So, Average atomic mass of X = 16x— 4+ 18 x 100 100 
But the average atomic mass of X has been given to be 16.2 u. Therefore, 
2% (100-x) = 16x— i 16.2 00 * 18 x T 
=1 o 5 16x+1800-18x 
100 
or 16.2 x 100 = 1800 - 2x 
or 2x = 1800 - 1620 
or 2x =180 
And x=180 
2 
or x =90 
: Thus, the percentage of the isotope X in the sample is 90%. The percentage 
of the other isotope '+ X in the sample will be 100 - 90 = 10%. 7 
2 koRADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES 
There are two types of isotopes: those which are stable and those which are unstable. The isotopes 
which are unstable (due to the presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei) and emit various types 
of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes (or just radioisotopes). The radiations (such as alpha 
particles, beta particles and gamma rays) are emitted by the unstable nuglei of the radioactive isotopes. 
Some of the common radioactive isotopes are: Carbon-14, Arsenic-74, Sodium-24, Iodine-131, Cobalt-60 
and Uranium-235. The high energy radiations emitted by radioactive isotopes are harmful to human 
beings. So, radioactive isotopes have to be used very, very carefully by taking suitable precautions and 
at proper concentrations to avoid damage. 
Applications of Radioactive Isotopes 
Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine to diagnose, study and treat various ailments. 
They are also used in power plants and in industry. Some of the important applications (or uses) of 
radioactive isotopes are given below. 
1. Radioactive isotopes are used as a fuel in nuclear reactors of nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
Uranium-235 isotope is used as a fuel in the reactors of nuclear power plants for generating 
electricity. This is done as follows: When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving 
neutrons, the heavy uranium nuclei break up to form two smaller nuclei and a tremendous amount of 
heat energy is produced. This heat energy is used to boil water in big boilers to form steam. The high 
pressure steam turns the turbines. The turbines run the generators to produce electricity. The process 
in which big uranium-235 nuclei are broken into smaller nuclei to obtain energy is called nuclear 
fission. The radioactive isotopes such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are also used for making 
atom bombs (or nuclear bombs). 
(a) Uranium-235 (b) A nuclear power plant 
Figure 34. Radioactive isotopes (such as uranium-235) are used as a fuel in the nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
2. Radioactive isotopes are used as ‘tracers’ in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and 
blood clots, etc., in the human body. 
A small amount of the low activity radioactive compound (called tracer) is either injected into the 
body of a person or given orally. This radioactive compound moves through the body and accumulates 
in the area of tumor, blood clot, etc. The exact position of the accumulated radioactive tracer can befound with the help of a device called Geiger counter. This gives the exact position of the tumor or 
blood clot and is of great help to the doctors for deciding further treatment. Arsenic-74 tracer is used 
to detect the presence of tumors and sodium-24 tracer is used to detect the presence of blood clots. 
3. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
Cobalt-60 radioisotope is used to cure cancer. When the high energy gamma radiations emitted 
by cobalt-60 radioisotopes are directed at the cancerous tumor in the human body, the cancerous cells 
get burnt. The treatment of cancer by using radioactive radiations is called radiotherapy. 
(a) This is cobalt-60 radioisotope. It produces (b) A carefully controlled beam of gamma rays s used to kill 
high energy gamma rays. cancer cells in the human body. It is called radiotherapy. 
Figure 35. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
4. Radioactive isotopes are used to determine the activity of thyroid gland which helps in the 
treatment of diseases like goitre. 
Doctors use iodine-131 radioisotope as a tracer 
to find how and at what rate the thyroid gland in our 
body takes up iodine (which is essential for making 
thyroxine hormone). This helps in the treatment of 
diseases like goitre. 
5. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry to 
detect the leakage in underground oil pipelines, 
gas pipelines and water pipes. 
To check the leakage in a metal pipeline, a  Figure 36. Radioactive isotopes being used for 
solution of the radioactive substance is introduced in  detectingleakagein underground pipeline carrying oil

radioactive solution will leak out, and the radioactive 
detector (called Geiger counter) will indicate a higher level of radiations. 
We have just studied isotopes which are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number 
but different mass numbers. It is, however, also possible that in some cases, the atoms of different 
elements having different atomic numbers may have the same mass number. Such atoms are called 
isobars. We can now say that: Isobars are the atoms of different elements having different atomic 
numbers but the same mass number (or same atomic mass). Isobars have different number of protons in their nuclei but the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in them is the same. An example

elements having different atomic numbers of 18 and 20 respectively but the same mass number of 40. i ; 0 ; L 4 i of isobars is argon, 5 Ar, and calcium, , Ca. This is because argon and calcium are atoms of different

. . A . < 24 % 24 Here is another example of isobars. The radioactive sodium, ;,N@, and magnesium |, Mg, are 
isobars. This is because radioactive sodium and magnesium are different elements having different 
atomic numbers of 11 and 12 respectively but the same mass number of 24. 
In order to find out isobars from among a number of given species, we should look at their atomic 
numbers and mass numbers. The atomic species having different atomic numbers but same mass 
number will be isobars. We will now solve some problems based on isobars.

toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it

was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in
them which are called subatomic particles.

Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral.

Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge.

Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus.

Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons,
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together
to give the structure of atom.

(a) Combing the hair produces electric charge. (b) Electrically charged comb then attracts tiny pieces of paper.

The electric charge produced on the comb (on rubbing in hair) comes from the atoms present in the
comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).

Science for Ninth Class: Chemistry 201
Charged Particles in Matter

If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible.

DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON

The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons.

Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied,
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron
as follows.

Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish light in the above gas discharge
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream

of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of
negatively charged particles called electrons.

The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons

_ are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms

contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron
and minus sign for negative charge).
Characteristics of an Electron
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below.
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about [949 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which

is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass

of an electron is u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-78 gram. The mass of an

1
1840
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored
while calculating the atomic mass of an element.

2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb of negative
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative

charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one).

DISCOVERY OF PROTON

The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms
contain positively charged particles called protons.

The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses
and different charges.

Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus,
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of
an electron from a hydrogen atom.

Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas

charged subatomic particle called proton. The term — above picture) is produced when invisible anode

Rutherford who showed it to bea hydrogen nucleus. The anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas in the
So, the discoverer of proton is generally saidtobeErnest —_ discharge tube consist of positively charged particles
Rutherford. called protons.
The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms.
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays.
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton
as follows.

The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p*
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge).

Characteristics of a Proton
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-74 gram.

2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron.
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one).

The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them.

DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON

After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So,
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units?
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932.
This particle is called neutron. The neutron isa neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom.
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n.

Characteristics of a Neutron

The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-*4 gram.

24 ERT
2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral.

We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now,

Atomic mass = Massof + Mass of
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons

6x1+6x1
12u

Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored.

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

Dalton’ atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible - which could not be broken down into
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below.

THOMSON’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom:

1, An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons
embedded in it.

2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge.

Thomson's model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.

Thomson's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson's model of mrte fe]
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s one
experiments.

Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as o.-particles). Alpha particle
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually
a helium ion, He?*. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium.
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will
now describe Rutherford’s experiment.

Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus

After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.

We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively
charged nucleus in the atom.

A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than
the radius of the atom.

From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about
the nucleus of an atom:

(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged.
(ii) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard.
(iii) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.
Nucleus

The nucleus is a small positively charged
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus
contains all the protons and neutrons,
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons,
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due
to the presence of protons in it. The number of
protons in the nucleus determines the number
of positive charges on the nucleus. The neutrons
which are also present in the nucleus have no
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons
taken together are known as nucleons (because
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of

ras dygear

the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford.

Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom.
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this
improved model of atom now.

RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom.
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows:

1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the
entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the
nucleus.

3. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and negatively charged
electrons holds the atom together.
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom
is equal.
5. Most of the atom is empty space.
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom.
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note

that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it
is electrically neutral.

Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom

A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion.

In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path,
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around

the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively

charged
electron

According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the

nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously Positively
pT 4 | charged

by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease nucleus

gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons

will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how

nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the anenergy losing electron could fall

nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus.
by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence
the atom should collapse. ac

But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the mY studygear
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own.
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom.

Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom

In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr:

1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits
farther from the nucleus have higher energy.

2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus,
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy
levels” or “electron shells”.

BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described
as follows:

1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral.
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on
the whole is electrically neutral.

2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged.

3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted
from the centre outwards.

4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of
32 electrons.

5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the
maximum energy.

6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes down
from a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

ATOMIC NUMBER :

We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is
known as atomic number of that element. That is:

Atomic number = Number of protons
of anelement in one atom of element

For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6.
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1.
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11,
so we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1.

All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various

-elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of
protons in them).

In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in
a neutral atom of that element. That is,
Atomic number = Number of electrons
of anelement in one neutral atom

For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either
less or more electrons than protons.

Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change,
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same.

It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things:
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element.
2. It tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element.

For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons.
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number
of an element.

MASS NUMBER

An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23.
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one
atom of an element is known as its mass number.

The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows.
We have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Now, Mass of a proton = 1 u
And, Mass of a neutron = lu
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so:
Mass number = Atomic mass
Thus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23,
then its atomic mass will be 23 u.

Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number

We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We
have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper

left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below:

Mass
number

Atomic | *
number

For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as:
ne
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass
number of carbon. Lct us solve some problems now.
Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element?
Nottscim We know that:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12
And, Atomic number = 23 - 12
=11

The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If,
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol
becomes °*Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number.

The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8.
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom?
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question)

(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8.

(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is,
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero).

Wiiyt@ucoetaiiem Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)
We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom.
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus
has been given to be 2. Now,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

So, 4 =2 +No. of neutrons
And, No.of neutrons =4-2
=

Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons.

ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE ATOMS
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P.

Ist energy level is K shell

2nd energy level is L shell
3rd energy level is M shell
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

M N<+—— Electron shells

First energy level

Fourth energy level —>

18 32 <«—— Maximum number of
electrons which can be
accommodated in the
various shells

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N)

The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on.
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level.

We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy

.the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on.

Electronic Configurations of Elements
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element

is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the
214 "Bilis bated baba es
distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell,
etc.
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things:
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element.
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different
shells of the atom.

The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element,
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons.

The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme:

1, The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the
atom is given by 2n? (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom.

(i) For 1st energy level, n = 1
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n?
= 2''(¥)
=2x1
=2
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n = 2
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n?
=2~x (2)?
=2x4
=8
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n?
. = 2 x (3)?
=2x9
= 18
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n?
= 2 x (4)?
=2x 16
= 32
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2,
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now,
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows:

Electron shell Maximum capacity

K shell 2 electrons
L shell 8 electrons
M shell 18 electrons
N shell 32 electrons
2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons)

This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only.
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell
(K shell) in its atom.

3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely
filled with electrons

This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes.

Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements.

Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12.

Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a

Sample Problem 1.

Solution.

maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we
K
write 5 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L

L
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write 3° In this way 2 + 8

= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons.

M
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write - for it. Writing all the

electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes:

KLM

2,852
Please note that it is not necessary to write
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the
electronic configurations of the elements.
For example, the electronic configuration
of the element X of atomic number 12 can
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however,
better to indicate their shells also. Another
point to be noted is that we have given so
many details in the solution of this problem
just to make you understand the things
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arrangement
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23.

F Sample Problem 2.) Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon
= 6) (NCERT Book Question)
| Solution.| The atomic number of carbon is 6, so a carbon atom has 6 electrons in it. Out

of 6 electrons:
K

(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write ied
L

(ii) the remaining 6 - 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ,-

So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration

of a carbon atom) will be:

Sample Problem 3.) Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium
= 11) (NCERT Book Question)

The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons
will occupy K shell, the next 8 electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom
will be:

F Sample Problem 4.) What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion,
Na‘? What would be its atomic number?

The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, a neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11

electrons in it.

(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron
from a sodium atom. So, a sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus,

KL
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be or 2, 8.

(ii) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its

atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number

- of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that
of a sodium atom, which is 4,

Sample Problem 5. Explain why, sodium ion, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells.
(NCERT Book Question)
F Solution.] A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium ion Na*
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill

up K and L shells.
F Sample Problem 6.] If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)
K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons.
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2+ 8=10
electrons in it.

An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the
element?

There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell)
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons,
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2.
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the
atomic number of this element is 12.

Before we end this discussion, we would like to say a few words about the electronic configurations
of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We
know that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,
the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further

)

The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the
outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they
decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part

in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us .

take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly.

The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.

223
So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be a Valence electron

Kel
a a In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost

shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium
atom has | valence electron.

Outermost shell
(Valence shell)

When a sodium atom combines with other atoms,
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells

(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure).

We can now say that those electrons of an atom
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another
atom.

(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms.

(ii) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their
atoms.

(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms.
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example.

What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having
atomic number 17? Name the valence shell of this atom.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17,
so one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be:

KLM
2BR7

Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus,
- there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X.

Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the

elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with
one another. This is discussed below.
Inertness of Noble Gases

There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium,
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells,
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are
very stable and hence chemically unreactive.

Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in
the atom. To have ‘2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and
no other shells are present in the atom.

It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gases
are monoatomic, that is, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same.
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

Cause of Chemical Combination

Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable.

An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways:
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom)

(ii) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom)

(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom)

If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations).

If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts)
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very
high energy required).

If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms.

VALENCY OF ELEMENTS

When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,

the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CHy. The valency of an element is also known as
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element.
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This
is discussed below.

Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons

The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom

Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7.
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom

There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element).

Types of Valency

There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first.

1. ELECTROVALENCY

In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear.

(a) Valency of Sodium

The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na’, having an inert gas
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain
these two cases yourself.

(b) Valency of Magnesium

The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself.

(c) Valency of Aluminium

The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, Al**,
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.

(d) Valency of Chlorine

The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, CI’, having an inert gas electron arrangement
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also
have the valency of 1 (or 1-).

(e) Valency of Oxygen

The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, O?-, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8.
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement,
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is
also 2. Explain it yourself.

(f) Valency of Nitrogen

The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has
- 5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure.
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N°>-, having an inert gas electron
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.
The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now.

2. COVALENCY

In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples.

(a) Covalency of Hydrogen

The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration.

Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear
to form a hydrogen molecule (H-H or H,).

(b) Covalency of Chlorine

A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl, each
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1.

(c) Covalency of Oxygen

An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2.

(d) Covalency of Nitrogen

A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N>, each nitrogen
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.
(e) Covalency of Carbon

The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet. It gets these electrons by
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares Figure 29. Model of methane
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the ne cae (Gris:
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its i¥etis dygear
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself.

The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur,
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency.

iiiacoutnee What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 12?

To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic

configuration will be aes . . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M

shell). So, one atom of this ‘element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium).

Siietaeciecnwes What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 15?
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be

= : = It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus).

If Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element.

in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron

as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achieve

Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question)

A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence
electrons in a chloride ion (CI-) will be 7 + 1 = 8.

ISOTOPES

In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons).
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons.
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly.

All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons.
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as:

vcl and Tat

Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below:

Figure 30. Diagrams of the two isotopes of chlorine.
It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Please
note that the difference in the masses of
isotopes of an element is due to the different
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and
hence they have different atomic masses of
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear
by now that whether we use the term “mass
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear
composition of isotopes in the examination,
then we should give the number of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example,

(i) Nuclear composition of Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons

Figure 31. Nuclear composition of the two isotopes of
chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls
represent neutrons).

(ii) Nuclear composition of “Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example:
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just
Cl-35), and
(ii) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just
Cl-37).
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon,
oxygen and neon.
1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be
represented as:

ft, pe et

The three isotopes of hydrogen, iH,7H and +H have been given the special names of protium,
deuterium and tritium respectively.
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as iH

Protium does not have a special symbol.
(ii) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as {H.

The special symbol of deuterium is D.
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as 7H.

The special symbol of tritium is T.
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium,
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

Name Isotope Protons Neutrons Electrons
Protium iH 1 0 1
Deuterium TH 1 1 1
Tritium 7H 1 2 1
It is clear from the above table that all the isotopes of hydrogen contain 1 proton and | electron
each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron;
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as:

Bae 2c ands..1C
These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal

number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 = 7
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons.

3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes:
) vieeryO and. UO

8
All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers

(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively.
4. Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as:

20. 21 22
Ne, jgNe and jNe

It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties.

All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties

The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons,
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same).
We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of
their electronic configurations as follows.

All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example,
the two isotopes of chlorine, ur and wee , both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes of
chlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence
electrons), they show identical chemical properties.

The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different

The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now, due to the presence
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of
chlorine, *c] and *’c}, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively.

Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements

The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two _ Figure 33. This flask contains
isotopes tl and wi with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one _ types of atoms, one having a mass
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 uin the — f35 uand the other having amass
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a sat atthe ree teamin
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will
become more clear from the following discussion.

(i) The chlorine isotope *°c| has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%.

(ii) The chlorine isotope 7Cl has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%.

This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass

of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass
of chlorine. So,

Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35 eta + 37x bes
100 100
a a
100 100
= 26.25 + 9.25
=35.5u

Thus, the average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u.

All the naturally occurring isotopes of an element are present in a fixed proportion, so the average
atomic mass of an element is fixed (or constant).
We will now solve some problems based on isotopes. In order to find out whether two (or more)
atoms are isotopes of the same element or not, we should look at the number of protons and neutrons
in them. If they contain the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, they will be
isotopes of the same element. The number of electrons in them will also be the same. This point will
be helpful in solving the following problems.

Sine cewcy(anm@e Ihe number of protons, neutrons and electrons in species A to E are given in
the following table:

Species Protons Neutrons Electrons
2 ik. tees 4
ee 22 18
= 17 20 17
Ba ee 10 11
E ee rns 17

Indicate from the above table the species that represent a pair of isotopes.

Those species which contain the same number of protons but different number
of neutrons will be a pair of isotopes. In the above table only two species C and
E have the same number of protons (17 each) but different number of neutrons
(20 and 18 respectively). Thus, C and E are a pair of isotopes. (Please note that
the atomic number 17 is of chlorine, so C and E are actually the two isotopes

of chlorine).

and which element or elements they represent? (NCERT Book Question)

Nroitiecim We know that:
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
So, Mass number of X=6+6
= {2
Mass number of Y=6+8
= 14
Thus, the mass number of X is 12 and that of Y is 14.
Now, X contains 6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of X is 6. Y contains
6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of Y is also 6. Since X and Y have the
same atomic number (of 6) but different mass numbers (of 12 and 14), they

are a pair of isotopes. Atomic number 6 is of carbon element. So, both X and
Y represent carbon element.

If the abundance of {Br isotope is 49.7% and that of $! Br isotope is 50.3%,
calculate the average atomic mass of bromine. (NCERT Book Question)
We know that upper digit in the symbol of an isotope represents its mass (which
is the same as its mass number). Now:
(i) The mass of 7? Br isotope is 79 u and its abundance is 49.7%.
(ii) The mass of 3;Br isotope is 81 u and its abundance is 50.3%.

Thus, the average atomic mass of bromine is 80 u.

A sample of an element X contains two isotopes Xx and * X . If the average
atomic mass of this sample of the element be 16.2 u, calculate the percentage
of the two isotopes in this sample. (NCERT Book Question)

In order to solve this problem, we will have to suppose that the percentage of
one of the isotopes in the sample is x, so that the percentage of the other isotope
in the sample will be (100 - x). Now:

So, Average atomic mass of bromine

(i) The mass of pes isotope is 16 u. Suppose its percentage in the sample is x

So, Average atomic mass of X = 16x—— .+.18x

RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES

There are two types of isotopes: those which are stable and those which are unstable. The isotopes
which are unstable (due to the presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei) and emit various types
of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes (or just radioisotopes). The radiations (such as alpha
particles, beta particles and gamma rays) are emitted by the unstable nuclei of the radioactive isotopes.
Some of the common radioactive isotopes are: Carbon-14, Arsenic-74, Sodium-24, Iodine-131, Cobalt-60
and Uranium-235. The high energy radiations emitted by radioactive isotopes are harmful to human
beings. So, radioactive isotopes have to be used very, very carefully by taking suitable precautions and
at proper concentrations to avoid damage.

Applications of Radioactive Isotopes

Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine to diagnose, study and treat various ailments.
They are also used in power plants and in industry. Some of the important applications (or uses) of
radioactive isotopes are given below.

1. Radioactive isotopes are used as a fuel in nuclear reactors of nuclear power plants for
generating electricity.

Uranium-235 isotope is used as a fuel in the reactors of nuclear power plants for generating
electricity. This is done as follows: When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving
neutrons, the heavy uranium nuclei break up to form two smaller nuclei and a tremendous amount of
heat energy is produced. This heat energy is used to boil water in big boilers to form steam. The high
pressure steam turns the turbines. The turbines run the generators to produce electricity. The process
in which big uranium-235 nuclei are broken into smaller nuclei to obtain energy is called nuclear
fission.The radioactive isotopes such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are also used for making
atom bombs (or nuclear bombs).

Figure 34. Radioactive isotopes (such as uranium-235) are used as a fuel in the nuclear power plants for
generating electricity.

2. Radioactive isotopes are used as ‘tracers’ in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and
blood clots, etc., in the human body.

A small amount of the low activity radioactive compound (called tracer) is either injected into the
body of a person or given orally. This radioactive compound moves through the body and accumulates
in the area of tumor, blood clot, etc. The exact position of the accumulated radioactive tracer can be
found with the help of a device called Geiger counter. This gives the exact position of the tumor or
blood clot and is of great help to the doctors for deciding further treatment. Arsenic-74 tracer is used
to detect the presence of tumors and sodium-24 tracer is used to detect the presence of blood clots.

3. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer.

Cobalt-60 radioisotope is used to cure cancer. When the high energy gamma radiations emitted
by cobalt-60 radioisotopes are directed at the cancerous tumor in the human body, the cancerous cells
get burnt. The treatment of cancer by using radioactive radiations is called radiotherapy.

(a) This is cobalt-60 radioisotope. It produces (b) Acarefully controlled beam of gamma rays is used to kill
high energy gamma rays. cancer cells in the human body. It is called radiotherapy.

Figure 35. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer.

4. Radioactive isotopes are used to determine the activity of thyroid gland which helps in the
treatment of diseases like goitre.

Doctors use iodine-131 radioisotope as a tracer
to find how and at what rate the thyroid gland in our
body takes up iodine (which is essential for making
thyroxine hormone). This helps in the treatment of
diseases like goitre.

5. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry to
detect the leakage in underground oil pipelines,
gas pipelines and water pipes.

To check the leakage in a metal pipeline, a Figure 36. Radioactive isotopes being used for
solution of the radioactive substance is introduced in _ detecting leakage in underground pipeline carrying oil

radioactive solution will leak out, and the radioactive
detector (called Geiger counter) will indicate a higher level of radiations.

We have just studied isotopes which are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number
but different mass numbers. It is, however, also possible that in some cases, the atoms of different
elements having different atomic numbers may have the same mass number. Such atoms are called
isobars. We can now say that: Isobars are the atoms of different elements having different atomic
numbers but the same mass number (or same atomic mass). Isobars have different number of protons

in their nuclei but the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in them is the same. An example
: : 40 , oe . '
of isobars is argon, ,, Ar , and calcium, - Ca. This is because argon and calcium are atoms of different

elements having different atomic numbers of 18 and 20 respectively but the same mass number of 40.

The complete nuclear composition of the isobars on Ar and i Ca. is given below: y

Here is another example of isobars. The radioactive sodium, ,,;Na@, and magnesium |, Mg, are

isobars. This is because radioactive sodium and magnesium are different elements having different
atomic numbers of 11 and 12 respectively but the same mass number of 24.

In order to find out isobars from among a number of given species, we should look at their atomic
numbers and mass numbers. The atomic species having different atomic numbers but same mass
number will be isobars. We will now solve some problems based on isobars.

244 Structure of Atom
STRUCTURE 
OF ATOM 
around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it 
was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now 
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in 
them which are called subatomic particles. 
Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has 
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral. 
Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire 
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very 
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge. 
Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus 
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral 
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus 
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. 
Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons, 
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not 
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and 
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together 
to give the structure of atom. ’- toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

(a) Combing the hair produces electric charge. (b) Electrically charged comb then attracts tiny pieces of paper. 
Figure 1.The electric charge produced on the comb (on rubbing in hair) comes from the atoms present in the 
comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).Charged Particles in Matter 
If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass 
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the 
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that 
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod 
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The 
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments 
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible. 
DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON 
The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed 
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of 
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called 
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does 
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively 
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all 
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons. 
Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge 
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied, 
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving 
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic 
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron 
as follows. 
Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish lightin the above gas discharge 
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike 
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream 
of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of 
negatively charged particles called electrons. 
The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons 
are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms 
contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron 
and minus sign for negative charge).Characteristics of an Electron 
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about 7277 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which 
is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass 
1 
of an electron is @ u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-28 gram. The mass of an 
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored 
while calculating the atomic mass of an element. 
2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb of negative 
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-1° coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any 
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative 
charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one). 
DISCOVERY OF PROTON 
The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles 
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles 
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms 
contain positively charged particles called protons. 
The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When 
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge 
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of 
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge 
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases 
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses 
and different charges. 
Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles 
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from 
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus, 
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of 
an electron from a hydrogen atom. 
Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas 
sometimes credited with the discovery of positively  discharge tube (seen on the extreme left side in the 
charged subatomic particle called proton. The term above picture) is produced when invisible anode

So, the discoverer of proton is generally said tobe Ernest  discharge tube consist of positively charged particles 
Rutherford. called protons.The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms. 
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons 
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a 
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays. 
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest 
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively 
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton 
as follows. 
The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons 
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms 
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p* 
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge). 
Characteristics of a Proton 
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since 
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a 
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is 
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton 
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-# gram. 
2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron. 
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-° coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!° coulomb 
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit 
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative 
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one). 
The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low 
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation 
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the 
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them. 
DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON 
After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot 
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom 
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So, 
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong 
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units? 
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932. 
This particle is called neutron. The neutron is a neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom. 
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain 
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen 
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n. 
Characteristics of a Neutron 
The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below. 
1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the 
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-2 gram. 
208 : D el L2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral. 
We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon 
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6 
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now, 
Atomic mass = Mass of + Mass of 
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons 
6x1+6x1 
12u 
Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons 
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored. Figure 6. James Chadwick:

STRUCTURE OF ATOM 
Dalton's atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible — which could not be broken down into 
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom 
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that 
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons 
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom 
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson 
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below. 
THOMSON'’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were 
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom: 
1. An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons 
embedded in it. 
2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is 
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge. 
‘Thomson’s model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains 
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive 
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal 
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.The coloured area 
contains all the 
positive charge 
in the atom 
The negatively 
charged electrons are spread 
throughout the positive charge

Thomsor's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded 
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We 
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part 
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds 
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson’s model of EzdERE 
- m?s[udygear 
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the 
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s 
experiments. 
Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus 
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as a.-particles). Alpha particle 
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually 
a helium ion, He**. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium. 
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through 
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin 
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will 
now describe Rutherfords experiment.

Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus 
After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these 
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons 
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery 
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.When fast moving alpha particles are allowed to strike a very thin gold foil in vacuum, it is found 
that: 
1. Most of the alpha particles pass 
straight through the gold foil 
without any deflection from their 
original path (see Figure 13).

deflected. Since most of the alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil 7 
without any deflection, it shows that there is a lot of empty space in the atom. mYstudygear 
We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body 
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha 
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre 
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles 
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as 
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively 
charged nucleus in the atom. 
A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained 
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by 
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles 
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which 
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the 
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected 
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of 
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than 
the radius of the atom. 
From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment 
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about 
the nucleus of an atom: 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged. 2 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard. 
(i) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.Nucleus 
The nucleus is a small positively charged 
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus 
contains all the protons and neutrons, 
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons, 
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible 
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due 
to the presence of protons in it. The number of 
protons in the nucleus determines the number 
ofpositive charges on th.e nucleus. The neutrons Figure14. The nucleus of an atom is extremely small as 
which are also present in the nucleus have no compared to the size of the atom as a whole. The relative 
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons size of the nucleus in an atom is roughly the same as that 
taken together are known as nucleons (because of a pea in the middle of this large stadium. 
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of rnvstudygear 
the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear 
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown 
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford. [Ezsm 
=% Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in 
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom. 
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom 
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s 
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this 
improved model of atom now. 
THERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom. 
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows: 
1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons 
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the 
entire mass of an atom 
is concentrated in the 
nucleus.

electrons holds the atom together. 
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom 
is equal. 
5. Most of the atom is empty space. 
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom. 
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to 
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron 
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen 
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note 
that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus 
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure 
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it 
is electrically neutral. 
Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom 
A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the 
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion. 
In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the 
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path, 
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around 
the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively 
charged 
electron According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a 
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must 
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this 
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will 
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the 
nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously 
by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease 
gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons Positively charged nucleus 
will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how 
nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the an energy losing electron could fall 
nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus. 
- SomcairtiinGesshemsty -by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence 
the atom should collapse. ac 
But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the ~ mYstudygear 
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own. ol 
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom. 
Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom 
In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of 
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr: 
1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy 
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount 
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits 
farther from the nucleus have higher energy. 
2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus, 
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around 
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they 
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or 
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy 
levels” or “electron shells”. 
BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM 
The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described 
as follows: 
1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have 
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral. 
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on 
the whole is electrically neutral. 
2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to 
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged. 
3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels 
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 
4,5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted 
from the centre outwards. 
4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For 
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy 
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold 
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of 
32 electrons. 
5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest 
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the 
maximum energy. 
6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same 
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place 
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes downfrom a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps 
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a 
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number 
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define 
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is 
known as atomic number of that element. That is: (O] 
Atomic number = Number of protons 
of an element  in one atom of element 
For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium 
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6. 
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. 
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11, 
50 we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And 
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1. 
All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence 
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons 
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic 
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used 
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other 
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which 
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various 
elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of 
protons in them). 
In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in 
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in 
a neutral atom of that element. That is,Atomic number = Number of electrons 
of an element  in one neutral atom 
For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is 
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number 
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal 
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons 
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either 
less or more electrons than protons. 
Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a 
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change, 
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change 
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same. 
It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things: 
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element. 
2. 1t tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element. 
For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons. 
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number 
of an element. 
MASS NUMBER 
An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the 
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons 
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number 
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass 
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no 
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element 
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23. 
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen 
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken 
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one 
atom of an element is known as its mass number. 
The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows. 
We have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Now,  Mass of a proton =1u i 
And, Mass of a neutron =1u 
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1 
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons 
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so: 
Mass number = Atomic massThus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass 
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23, 
then its atomic mass will be 23 u. 
Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number 
We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We 
have just seen that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can 
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic 
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper 
left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below: 
Mass 
number 
Atomic 
number 
For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as: 
12, 
C 6 
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass 
number of carbon. Let us solve some problems now. 
I I SCIUSUEY Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass 
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element? 
BTt We know that: 
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons 
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12 
And, Atomic number =23 - 12 
=11 
The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If, 
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol 
becomes 2Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number. 
The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8. 
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom? 
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question) 
(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this 
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8. 
(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and 
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is, 
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero). i 
Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How 
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom. 
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number 
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus 
has been given to be 2. Now, 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, 4 =2 + No. of neutrons 
And, No. of neutrons =4-2 
=2 
Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons. 
ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE MS 
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In 
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or 
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells 
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P. 
1st energy level is K shell 
2nd energy level is L shell 
3rd energy level is M shell 
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N) 
The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted 
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest 
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on. 
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level. 
‘We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a 
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy 
the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy 
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. 
Electronic Configurations of Elements 
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element 
is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the 
214 *distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell, 
etc. 
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things: 
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element. 
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different 
shells of the atom. 
The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element, 
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the 
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons. 
The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given 
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme: 
1. The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the 
atom is given by 2n% (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum 
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom. 
(i) For st energy level, n =1 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n? 5 
=2x (1) 
=2x1 
=2 
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n =2 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n? 
=i 
=2x4 
=8 
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n? 
. =12.% (3)2 
=2x9 
=18 
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4 
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n? 
(e 
=2x16 
=32 
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2, 
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now, 
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is 
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum 
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18 
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows: 
Electron shell Max capacity 
K shell 2 electrons 
L shell . ‘ 8 electrons 
M shell 18 electrons 
N shell 32 electrons2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the 
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first 
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons) 
This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only. 
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons 
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons 
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell 
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the 
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also 
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell 
(K shell) in its atom. 
3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely 
filled with electrons 
This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons 
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule 
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes. 
Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements. 
W Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12. 
Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has 
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a Solution. 
maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we 
K write 3 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L 
L 
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write s In this way 2 + 8 
= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons. 
M 
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write & for it. Writing all the 
electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes: 
KLM 
2,80 
Please note that it is not necessary to write 
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the 
electronic configurations of the elements. 
For example, the electronic configuration 
of the element X of atomic number 12 can 
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however, 
better to indicate their shells also. Another 
point to be noted is that we have given so 
many details in the solution of this problem 
just to make you understand the things 
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arra.ngement 
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23. Figure 23. Figure for sample 
problem 1.m Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon 
=6) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of carbon is 6, so a carbon atom has 6 electrons in it. Out 
of 6 electrons: K 
(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write 5 
(ii) the remaining 6 — 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ];. 
So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration 
of a carbon atom) will be: 
K L or Prghils 
254 
m Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium 
=11) (NCERT Book Question) 
m The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom 
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons 
will occupy K shell, the next § electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining 
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom 
will be: 
X LMl 8 8, 1 
ke el 
m What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion, 
Na+? What would be its atomic number? 
The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, 2 neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11 
electrons in it. 
(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron 
from a sodium atom. S0, 2 sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus, 
K 
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be L or 2, 8. 
> 
(if) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its 
atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number 
of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that 
of a sodium atom, which is 11. 
m Explain why, sodium jon, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
m A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of 
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the 
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium jon Na* 
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill 
up Kand L shells. 
m If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons 
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons. 
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2 + 8 = 10 
electrons in it. 
An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the 
element? 
There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means 
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell) 
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons, 
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has 
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2. 
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number 
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the 
atomic number of this element is 12. - y

of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We 
Kknow that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy 
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This 
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further

VALENCE ELECTRONS (OR VALENCY ELECTRONS) 
The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us . take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly. 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be 1 (— Valence electron 
Kl "M, 
5 oihe In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost 
shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron 
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium 
atom has 1 valence electron. «— Outermost shell 
(Valence shell) 
When a sodium atom combines with other atoms, 
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part 
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells 
(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part 
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron 
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure). 
We can now say that those electrons of an atom « 
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located 
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either 
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another 
atom. 
(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms. 
(if) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their 
atoms. 
(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write 
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell 
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence 
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example. 
What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having 
atomic number 172 Name the valence shell of this atom. 
In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the 
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17, 
s0 one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be: 
KL M 
24857 
Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus, 
there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X. 
Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the 
elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with 
one another. This is discussed below.Inertness of Noble Gases 
There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium, 
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they 
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons 
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we 
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow 
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic 
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

3. Argon Ar 18 58 @ 8 
4. Krypton Kr o 8 
5. Xenon Xe s A 8 
6. . Rn g 18 o % 5 8 
If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we 
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have 
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can 
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold 
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost 
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells, 
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable 
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of 
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion 
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are 
very stable and hence chemically unreactive. 
Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of 
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in 
the atom. To have 2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is 
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here 
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons 
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and 
no other shells are present in the atom. 
It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements 
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely 
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble 
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost 
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases 
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gasesare monoatomic, that s, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same. 
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

electrons). All other noble gases have neon signs) because it glows when bulbs to prevent the tungsten

oxygen in air. 
Cause of Chemical Combination 
Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron 
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron 
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do 
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost 
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost 
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of 
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable. 
An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways: 
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom) 
(i) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom) 
(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom) 
If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons 
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged 
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations). 
If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts) 
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively 
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very 
high energy required). 
If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose 
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the 
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons 
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms. 
VALENCY OF ELEMENTS 
When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they 
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of 
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element 
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four 
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CH,. The valency of an element is also known as 
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element. 
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other 
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This 
is discussed below. 
Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons 
The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in 
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element 
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons 
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron 
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of 
valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom 
Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7. 
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine 
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete 
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to 
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is, 
Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom 
There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is 
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element). 
Types of Valency 
There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the 
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known 
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds 
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of 
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first. 
1. ELECTROVALENCY 
In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons 
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration 
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have 
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative 
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear. 
(a) Valency of Sodium 
The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in 
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na*, having an inert gas 
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electronconfiguration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19 
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain 
these two cases yourself. 
(b) Valency of Magnesium 
The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons 
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium 
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses 
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is 
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number 
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself. 
(c) Valency of Aluminium 
The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons 
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, A%, 
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to 
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic 
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself. 
(d) Valency of Chlorine 
The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has 
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it nceds 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the 
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, I, having an inert gas electron arrangement 
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so 
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also 
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each 
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also 
have the valency of 1 (or 1-). 
(e) Valency of Oxygen 
The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has 
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom 
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, 0%, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. 
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, 
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is 
also 2. Explain it yourself. 
(f) Valency of Nitrogen 
The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has 
5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. 
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N3-, having an inert gas electron 
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas 
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus 
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so 
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and 
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now. 
OVALENCY 
In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons 
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known 
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its 
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples. 
(a) Covalency of Hydrogen 
The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its 
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has 
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs 
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom 
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen  Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron oM @ hydrogen molecule (H-H or Hy). 
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of 
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share 
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of 
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining 
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration. 
(b) Covalency of Chlorine 
A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron 
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom 
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl,, each 
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1. 
(c) Covalency of Oxygen 
An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another 
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom 
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency 
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen 
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2. 
(d) Covalency of Nitrogen 
A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of 
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares 
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or 
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N, each nitrogen 
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.(e) Covalency of Carbon 
The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration 
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires 
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet’ It gets these electrons by 
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four 
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron 
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons 
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the 
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the 
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares 
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the 
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its mvstu dygear 
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself. g 
The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur, Bz 
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show 
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency 
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not 
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency. 
I Uil What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 127 
To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic 
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic 
KLM Figure 29. Model of methane 
molecule (CH,). 
configuration will be . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M 
shell). So, one atom of tl"lis ’element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest 
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2 
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It 
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium). 
T ISPl What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 152 
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be 
;( ;‘ I;/[ It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to 
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element 
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency 
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus). 
I TS IS [f Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element. 
(NCERT Book Question) 
The symbol Z stands for the atomic number of an element. By saying that 
Z = 3, we mean that the atomic number of this element is 3. The electronic 
configuration of the element having atomic number 3 is K L1t has 1 electron ’ g 
in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron 
to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement of ? (which is the same 
as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achievethe inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency is 1. The element 
having atomic number 3 is lithium. 
The number of valence electrons in a chloride ion, Cl-, are: 
(a) 16 (b) 8 (B)e17 (d) 18 
Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question) 
A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by 
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence 
electrons in a chloride ion (Cl-) willbe 7 + 1 = 8. 
ISOTOP 
In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’ 
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms 
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an 
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons). 
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons. 
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us 
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly. 
All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is 
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons. 
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has 
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as: 
wal and el 
Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers 
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below:

It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use 
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes 
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Pleasenote that the difference in the masses of 
isotopes of an element is due to the different 
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For 
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain 
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and 
hence they have different atomic masses of 
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear 
by now that whether we use the term “mass ” 2 
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition (a) ;7Cl contains 17 ®) 17 Cl contains 17 protons 
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another protusianc ® pevirons an R 
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear 
composition of isotopes in the examination, 
then we should give the number of protons 
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example, Figure 31. Nuclear composition of the two isotopes of 
chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls 
represent neutrons). 
(i) Nuclear composition of ;;Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons 
(ii) Nuclear composition of /Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons 
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers 
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example: 
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just 
Cl-35), and 
(if) 'The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just 
Cl-37). 
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon, 
oxygen and neon. 
1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number 
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be 
represented as: ‘ a 
RE S EIE tand e 
The three isotopes of hydrogen, JH,/H and ’H have been given the special names of protium, 
deuterium and tritium respectively. 
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as H 
Protium does not have a special symbol. 
(i) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as ;H. 
The special symbol of deuterium is D. 
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as *H . 
The special symbol of tritium is T. 
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium, 
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope 
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron; 
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of 
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as: 
i, Coand C These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal 
number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 =7 
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons. 
3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes: 
Qaagk0 and . O 
All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers 
(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively. 
4, Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as: 
BNe, =Ne and ZNe 
It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number 
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will 
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. 
All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties 
The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons, 
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons 
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same). 
‘We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of 
their electronic configurations as follows. 
All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have 
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes 
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence 
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example, 
the two isotopes of chlorine, Cl and Cl, both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due 
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes ofchlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence 
electrons), they show identical chemical properties. 
The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different 
The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now; due to the presence 
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since 
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of 
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have 
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because 
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of 
chlorine, %Cl and ¥cl, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different 
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively. 
Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements 
The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not 
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u 
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of 
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different 
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope 
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the 
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most 
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two  Ejgyre 33. This flask contains 
isotopes fjc] and "Zc1 with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two 
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one types of atoms, one having a mass 
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 u in the ~ ©f35uandtheotherhavingamass 
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a g;?z a‘;g‘;?;g:i::{?:;:z;g;;r 
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This ) 
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will 
become more clear from the following discussion. 
(i) The chlorine isotope ol has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%. 
(i) The chlorine isotope €N has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%. 
This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass 
of chlorine. So, 
75 25 Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35x— + 37x—

«d2925%,. 925. sdf¥E2 g, i 
100 100 
=26.25 +9.25 
=355u 
Thus, the average atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u. 
All the naturally occurring isotopes of an element are present in a fixed proportion, so the average 
atomic mass of an element is fixed (or constant).‘We will now solve some problems based on isotopes. In order to find out whether two (or more) 
atoms are isotopes of the same element or not, we should look at the number of protons and neutrons 
in them. If they contain the same number of protons but different number of neutrons, they will be 
isotopes of the same element. The number of electrons in them will also be the same. This point will 
be helpful in solving the following problems. 
§ The number of protons, neutrons and electrons in species A to E are given in 
the following table: 
Neutrons Electrons 
6 4 
22 18 
20 17 
10 11 
18 17 
Indicate from the above table the species that represent a pair of isotopes. 
Those species which contain the same number of protons but different number 
of neutrons will be a pair of isotopes. In the above table only two species C and 
E have the same number of protons (17 each) but different number of neutrons 
(20 and 18 respectively). Thus, C and E are a pair of isotopes. (Please note that 
the atomic number 17 is of chlorine, so C and E are actually the two isotopes 
of chlorine). 
BRI ERYTINENeN Composition of the nuclei of two atomic species X and Y is given as under: 
X 
Protons : 6 6 
Neutrons: 6 8 
Give the mass numbers of X and Y. What is the relation between the two species 
and which element or elements they represent? (NCERT Book Question) 
MUITTOIE We know that: 
Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons 
So, Mass number of X=6+6 
=12 
Mass number of Y=6+8 
=14 
Thus, the mass number of X is 12 and that of Y is 14. 
Now; X contains 6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of X is 6. Y contains 
6 protons, therefore, the atomic number of Y is also 6. Since X and Y have the 
same atomic number (of 6) but different mass numbers (of 12 and 14), they 
are a pair of isotopes. Atomic number 6 is of carbon element. So, both X and 
Y represent carbon element. 
AR GOIIEVIREN Bromine occurs in nature mainly in the form of two isotopes 7; Br and §, Br. 
If the abundance of J;Br isotope is 49.7% and that of i Brisotope is 50.3%, 
calculate the average atomic mass of bromine. (NCERT Book Question) 
___ sclnoetr s chomsty 2‘We know that upper digit in the symbol of an isotope represents its mass (which 
is the same as its mass number). Now: 
(i) The mass of ;ZBr isotope is 79 u and its abundance is 49.7%. 
ii) The mass of 5 Br isotope is 81 u and its abundance is 50.3%. 3 i

Thus, the average atomic mass of bromine is 80 u. 
SETU NS A sample of an element X contains two isotopes eX and 's X . If the average 
atomic mass of this sample of the element be 16.2 u, calculate the percentage 
of the two isotopes in this sample. (NCERT Book Question) 
In order to solve this problem, we will have to suppose that the percentage of 
one of the isotopes in the sample is x, so that the percentage of the other isotope 
in the sample will be (100 - x). Now: 
(i) The mass of ‘; X isotope is 16 u. Suppose its percentage in the sample is x 
%. 
(i) The mass of X isotope is 18 u. Its percentage in the sample will be 
(100 - x) %. 
k o (100-x) 
So, Average atomic mass of X = 16x— 4+ 18 x 100 100 
But the average atomic mass of X has been given to be 16.2 u. Therefore, 
2% (100-x) = 16x— i 16.2 00 * 18 x T 
=1 o 5 16x+1800-18x 
100 
or 16.2 x 100 = 1800 - 2x 
or 2x = 1800 - 1620 
or 2x =180 
And x=180 
2 
or x =90 
: Thus, the percentage of the isotope X in the sample is 90%. The percentage 
of the other isotope '+ X in the sample will be 100 - 90 = 10%. 7 
2 koRADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES 
There are two types of isotopes: those which are stable and those which are unstable. The isotopes 
which are unstable (due to the presence of extra neutrons in their nuclei) and emit various types 
of radiations, are called radioactive isotopes (or just radioisotopes). The radiations (such as alpha 
particles, beta particles and gamma rays) are emitted by the unstable nuglei of the radioactive isotopes. 
Some of the common radioactive isotopes are: Carbon-14, Arsenic-74, Sodium-24, Iodine-131, Cobalt-60 
and Uranium-235. The high energy radiations emitted by radioactive isotopes are harmful to human 
beings. So, radioactive isotopes have to be used very, very carefully by taking suitable precautions and 
at proper concentrations to avoid damage. 
Applications of Radioactive Isotopes 
Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine to diagnose, study and treat various ailments. 
They are also used in power plants and in industry. Some of the important applications (or uses) of 
radioactive isotopes are given below. 
1. Radioactive isotopes are used as a fuel in nuclear reactors of nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
Uranium-235 isotope is used as a fuel in the reactors of nuclear power plants for generating 
electricity. This is done as follows: When uranium-235 atoms are bombarded with slow moving 
neutrons, the heavy uranium nuclei break up to form two smaller nuclei and a tremendous amount of 
heat energy is produced. This heat energy is used to boil water in big boilers to form steam. The high 
pressure steam turns the turbines. The turbines run the generators to produce electricity. The process 
in which big uranium-235 nuclei are broken into smaller nuclei to obtain energy is called nuclear 
fission. The radioactive isotopes such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are also used for making 
atom bombs (or nuclear bombs). 
(a) Uranium-235 (b) A nuclear power plant 
Figure 34. Radioactive isotopes (such as uranium-235) are used as a fuel in the nuclear power plants for 
generating electricity. 
2. Radioactive isotopes are used as ‘tracers’ in medicine to detect the presence of tumors and 
blood clots, etc., in the human body. 
A small amount of the low activity radioactive compound (called tracer) is either injected into the 
body of a person or given orally. This radioactive compound moves through the body and accumulates 
in the area of tumor, blood clot, etc. The exact position of the accumulated radioactive tracer can befound with the help of a device called Geiger counter. This gives the exact position of the tumor or 
blood clot and is of great help to the doctors for deciding further treatment. Arsenic-74 tracer is used 
to detect the presence of tumors and sodium-24 tracer is used to detect the presence of blood clots. 
3. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
Cobalt-60 radioisotope is used to cure cancer. When the high energy gamma radiations emitted 
by cobalt-60 radioisotopes are directed at the cancerous tumor in the human body, the cancerous cells 
get burnt. The treatment of cancer by using radioactive radiations is called radiotherapy. 
(a) This is cobalt-60 radioisotope. It produces (b) A carefully controlled beam of gamma rays s used to kill 
high energy gamma rays. cancer cells in the human body. It is called radiotherapy. 
Figure 35. Radioactive isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. 
4. Radioactive isotopes are used to determine the activity of thyroid gland which helps in the 
treatment of diseases like goitre. 
Doctors use iodine-131 radioisotope as a tracer 
to find how and at what rate the thyroid gland in our 
body takes up iodine (which is essential for making 
thyroxine hormone). This helps in the treatment of 
diseases like goitre. 
5. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry to 
detect the leakage in underground oil pipelines, 
gas pipelines and water pipes. 
To check the leakage in a metal pipeline, a  Figure 36. Radioactive isotopes being used for 
solution of the radioactive substance is introduced in  detectingleakagein underground pipeline carrying oil

radioactive solution will leak out, and the radioactive 
detector (called Geiger counter) will indicate a higher level of radiations. 
We have just studied isotopes which are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number 
but different mass numbers. It is, however, also possible that in some cases, the atoms of different 
elements having different atomic numbers may have the same mass number. Such atoms are called 
isobars. We can now say that: Isobars are the atoms of different elements having different atomic 
numbers but the same mass number (or same atomic mass). Isobars have different number of protons in their nuclei but the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in them is the same. An example

. . A . < 24 % 24 Here is another example of isobars. The radioactive sodium, ;,N@, and magnesium |, Mg, are 
isobars. This is because radioactive sodium and magnesium are different elements having different 
atomic numbers of 11 and 12 respectively but the same mass number of 24. 
In order to find out isobars from among a number of given species, we should look at their atomic 
numbers and mass numbers. The atomic species having different atomic numbers but same mass 
number will be isobars. We will now solve some problems based on isobars.

toms and molecules are the building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter

around us is due to the different types of atoms and molecules present in them. For a long time it

was thought that the atoms are indivisible, so they do not have an inner structure. We now
know that atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. Atoms have smaller particles in
them which are called subatomic particles.

Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electron has
negative charge, proton has positive charge, whereas neutron has no charge, it is neutral.

Protons and neutrons are present in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Almost the entire
mass of the atom is in the nucleus because the electrons, which are outside the nucleus, have very, very
small mass. Due to the presence of protons, nucleus has positive charge.

Electrons are outside the nucleus. The electrons in an atom revolve rapidly round the nucleus
in fixed circular paths called energy levels or shells. Since an atom on the whole is electrically neutral
(having no overall positive or negative charge), therefore, the number of electrons outside the nucleus
is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus.

Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three subatomic particles: electrons,
protons and neutrons. Hydrogen atom is made up of only one electron and one proton. It does not
contain any neutron. The atoms of different elements differ in the number of electrons, protons and
neutrons. We will now describe how electrons, protons and neutrons were discovered and put together
to give the structure of atom.

(a) Combing the hair produces electric charge. (b) Electrically charged comb then attracts tiny pieces of paper.

The electric charge produced on the comb (on rubbing in hair) comes from the atoms present in the
comb. This shows that some charged particles are present in the atoms of comb (and hence of other matter).

Science for Ninth Class: Chemistry 201
Charged Particles in Matter

If we rub a comb in dry hair, then this comb attracts small pieces of paper. And if we rub a glass
rod with a piece of silk cloth and bring it near an inflated balloon, then the glass rod attracts the
balloon. We know that an electrically charged object can attract an uncharged object. This means that
on rubbing with dry hair, a comb gets an electric charge, and on rubbing with silk cloth, a glass rod
also gets an electric charge. Now, the question arises: Where does this electric charge come from? The
obvious answer is: from within the atoms present in the comb and glass rod. These simple experiments
tell us that some charged particles are present in the atoms of matter. So, the atom is divisible.

DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON

The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897. Thomson passed
electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge tube. Streams of
minute particles were given out by the cathode (negative electrode). These streams of particles are called
cathode rays (because they come out of cathode). The mass and charge of the cathode ray particles does
not depend on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Cathode rays consist of small, negatively
charged particles called electrons. Since all the gases form cathode rays, it was concluded that all
the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons.

Thomson explained the formation of cathode rays as follows. The gas taken in the discharge
tube consists of atoms, and all the atoms contain electrons. When high electrical voltage is applied,
the electrical energy pushes out some of the electrons from the atoms of the gas. These fast moving
electrons form cathode rays. Thus, the formation of cathode rays shows that one of the subatomic
particle present in all the atoms is the negatively charged ‘electron’. We can now define an electron
as follows.

Figure 2. J.J. Thomson: The scientist Figure 3.The greenish light in the above gas discharge
who discovered the negatively charged tube is produced when invisible cathode rays strike
subatomic particle called electron. on the glass walls of the discharge tube. The stream

of cathode rays in the gas discharge tube consists of
negatively charged particles called electrons.

The electron is a negatively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The electrons

_ are located outside the nucleus in an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one electron, all other atoms

contain more than one electron. An electron is usually represented by the symbol e~ (e for electron
and minus sign for negative charge).
Characteristics of an Electron
The two important characteristics of an electron are its mass and charge. These are described below.
1. Mass of an Electron. The mass of an electron is about [949 of the mass of hydrogen atom (which

is the atom of lowest mass). Since the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, we can say that the relative mass

of an electron is u. The absolute mass of an electron is, however, 9 x 10-78 gram. The mass of an

1
1840
electron is so small that it is considered to be negligible. This is why the mass of electrons is ignored
while calculating the atomic mass of an element.

2. Charge of an Electron. The absolute charge on an electron is 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb of negative
charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb has been found to be the smallest negative charge carried by any
particle. So, this is taken as the unit of negative charge. This means that an electron has 1 unit of negative

charge. In other words, the relative charge of an electron is, -1 (minus one).

DISCOVERY OF PROTON

The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles
called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles
to balance the negative charge of electrons. It has actually been found by experiments that all the atoms
contain positively charged particles called protons.

The existence of positively charged particles in the atoms was shown by E. Goldstein. When
Goldstein passed electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure taken in a discharge
tube, streams of heavy particles were given out by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of
particles are called anode rays. Anode rays consist of positively charged particles. The mass and charge
of the anode ray particles depends on the nature of gas taken in the discharge tube. Different gases
give different types of anode rays which contain positively charged particles having different masses
and different charges.

Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas and hydrogen atom is the lightest atom. So, the positive particles
obtained from hydrogen gas are the lightest and have the smallest charge. The anode rays obtained from
hydrogen gas are made up of the same type of positive particles. These particles are called protons. Thus,
the anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas consist of protons. A proton is formed by the removal of
an electron from a hydrogen atom.

Figure 4. Eugen Goldstein: The scientist who is Figure 5. The faint red glow in the above gas
sometimes credited with the discovery of positively discharge tube (seen on the extreme left side in the
charged subatomic particle called proton. The term — above picture) is produced when invisible anode

Rutherford who showed it to bea hydrogen nucleus. The anode rays obtained from hydrogen gas in the
So, the discoverer of proton is generally saidtobeErnest —_ discharge tube consist of positively charged particles
Rutherford. called protons.
The formation of protons can be explained as follows. Hydrogen gas consists of hydrogen atoms.
When high electrical voltage is applied to hydrogen gas, the electrical energy removes the electrons
from the hydrogen atoms. After the removal of negatively charged electron from a hydrogen atom, a
positively charged particle called proton is formed. These fast moving protons form the anode rays.
Please note that hydrogen atoms are the lightest of all the atoms, so hydrogen atoms form the lightest
positively charged particles called protons. The heavier atoms of other gases form heavier positively
charged particles which are made up of a number of protons held together. We can now define a proton
as follows.

The proton is a positively charged particle found in the atoms of all the elements. The protons
are located in the nucleus of an atom. Only hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus, atoms
of all other elements contain more than one proton. A proton is usually represented by the symbol p*
(p for proton and plus sign for positive charge).

Characteristics of a Proton
The two important characteristics of a proton are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Proton. The proton is actually a hydrogen atom which has lost its electron. Since
the mass of an electron is very small, we can say that the mass of a proton is equal to the mass of a
hydrogen atom. But the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 u, therefore, the relative mass of a proton is
1 u. If, however, we compare the mass of a proton with that of an electron, then the mass of a proton
is 1840 times that of an electron. The absolute mass of a proton is 1.6 x 10-74 gram.

2. Charge of a Proton. The charge of a proton is equal and opposite to the charge of an electron.
So, the absolute charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10-!9 coulomb of positive charge. Now, 1.6 x 10-'? coulomb
has been found to be the smallest positive charge carried by any particle. So, this is taken as the unit
of positive charge. This means that proton carries 1 unit positive charge. In other words, the relative
charge of a proton is +1 (plus one).

The formation of cathode rays and anode rays on passing electricity through gases at very low
pressure tells us that atom is not indivisible, it is made up of smaller particles. Actually, the formation
of cathode rays tells us that atoms contain negatively charged particles (electrons) inside them whereas the
formation of anode rays tells us that atoms contain positively charged particles (protons) in them.

DISCOVERY OF NEUTRON

After the discovery of protons and electrons, it was noticed that all the mass of an atom cannot
be accounted for on the basis of only protons and electrons present in it. For example, a carbon atom
contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So,
the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6 u, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong
because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12 u. Then, how do we explain this extra mass of 6 units?
This problem was solved by the discovery of another subatomic particle by James Chadwick in 1932.
This particle is called neutron. The neutron isa neutral particle found in the nucleus of an atom.
Atoms of all the elements contain neutrons except ordinary hydrogen atom which does not contain
any neutron. Thus, the subatomic particle not present in a hydrogen atom is neutron. A hydrogen
atom contains only one proton and one electron. A neutron is represented by the symbol n.

Characteristics of a Neutron

The two important characteristics of a neutron are its mass and charge. These are described below.

1. Mass of a Neutron. The mass of a neutron is equal to the mass of a proton. In other words, the
relative mass of a neutron is 1 u. The absolute mass of a neutron is 1.6 x 10-*4 gram.

24 ERT
2. Charge of a Neutron. Neutron has no charge. It is electrically neutral.

We are now in a position to explain why the atomic mass of carbon
is 12 u. It is now known that a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6
neutrons, each having a mass of 1 u. Now,

Atomic mass = Massof + Mass of
of carbon 6 protons 6 neutrons

6x1+6x1
12u

Thus, the atomic mass is given by the sum of the masses of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. The mass of electrons
present in an atom is very, very small, so it is ignored.

STRUCTURE OF ATOM

Dalton’ atomic theory suggested that atom was indivisible - which could not be broken down into
smaller particles. But the discovery of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons inside the atom
disproved this postulate of Dalton’s atomic theory. The discovery of electrons and protons suggested that
atoms are divisible and they do have an inner structure. After the discovery that atoms contain electrons
and protons, it became necessary to find out how these electrons and protons were arranged inside the atom
(Please note that the third subatomic particle neutron had not been discovered at that time). J.J. Thomson
was the first scientist to propose a model for the structure of atom. This is described below.

THOMSON’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

When J.J. Thomson proposed his model of the atom in 1903, then only electrons and protons were
known to be present in the atom. According to Thomson’s model of the atom:

1, An atom consists of a sphere (or ball) of positive charge with negatively charged electrons
embedded in it.

2. The positive and negative charges in an atom are equal in magnitude, due to which an atom is
electrically neutral. It has no overall positive or negative charge.

Thomson's model of the atom is shown in Figure 7. The coloured area in the sphere (or ball) contains
all the positive charge in the atom. The negatively charged electrons are spread throughout the positive
charge. The total negative charge of electrons is equal to the total positive charge of the sphere. These equal
and opposite charges balance each other due to which an atom becomes electrically neutral on the whole.

Thomson's model of the atom is similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons embedded
in a sphere of positive charge are like the currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We
can also compare Thomson's model of atom to a watermelon. The red, edible part
of watermelon represents the sphere of positive charge whereas the black seeds
embedded in watermelon are like the electrons. Although Thomson's model of mrte fe]
atom explained the electrically neutral nature of atom but it could not explain the
results of various experiments carried out by other scientists such as Rutherford’s one
experiments.

Before we describe Rutherford’s experiment which led to the discovery of a positively charged nucleus
in the atom, we should know the meaning of alpha particles (also written as o.-particles). Alpha particle
is a positively charged particle having 2 units of positive charge and 4 units of mass. It is actually
a helium ion, He?*. Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive clements like radium and polonium.
The fast moving alpha particles have a considerable amount of energy. They can penetrate through
matter to some extent. We will also be using a gold foil in this experiment. A gold foil is a very thin
sheet of gold. Alpha particles are much smaller than the gold atoms present in the gold foil. We will
now describe Rutherford’s experiment.

Rutherford’s Experiment — Discovery of Nucleus

After the discovery of electrons, protons and neutrons, it became clear that an atom is made up of these
three subatomic particles. Experiments were then carried out to find out how electrons, protons and neutrons
were arranged in an atom. It was Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment which led to the discovery
of a small positively charged nucleus in the atom containing all the protons and neutrons.

We know that similar charges repel cach other. So, a positively charged body
will repel another positively charged body. The observation that some of the alpha
particles are deflected through small and large angles shows that there is a ‘centre
of positive charge’ in the atom which repels the positively charged alpha particles
and deflects them from their original path. This centre of positive charge in the atom is known as
nucleus. Thus, the scattering of alpha particles by a thin gold foil shows the existence of a positively
charged nucleus in the atom.

A very few of the alpha particles are turned back on their path. This fact cannot be explained
only on the basis of repulsion due to positive charge of the nucleus. It can, however, be explained by
assuming that the nucleus is very dense and hard. So, the observation that a very few alpha particles
completely rebound on hitting the gold foil shows that the nucleus is very dense and hard which
does not allow the alpha particles to pass through it. Since the nucleus is very dense, practically the
whole mass of an atom is centred at its nucleus. As the number of alpha particles which are deflected
is very small, we conclude that the size of the nucleus must be very small as compared to the size of
the atom as a whole. In fact, the radius of nucleus has been found to be about 10° times smaller than
the radius of the atom.

From the above discussion we conclude that Rutherford’s alpha-particle scattering experiment
shows the presence of a nucleus in the atom. It also gives the following important information about
the nucleus of an atom:

(i) Nucleus of an atom is positively charged.
(ii) Nucleus of an atom is very dense and hard.
(iii) Nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the size of the atom as a whole.
Nucleus

The nucleus is a small positively charged
part at the centre of an atom. The nucleus
contains all the protons and neutrons,
therefore, almost the entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the nucleus (the electrons,
which are outside the nucleus, have negligible
mass). The positive charge on the nucleus is due
to the presence of protons in it. The number of
protons in the nucleus determines the number
of positive charges on the nucleus. The neutrons
which are also present in the nucleus have no
charge, they are neutral. Protons and neutrons
taken together are known as nucleons (because
they are present in the nucleus). The volume of

size of the nucleus in an atom is roughly the same as that

ras dygear

the nucleus of an atom is very small as compared to the volume of the extranuclear
part of the atom. The existence of positively charged nucleus in an atom was shown
by the alpha particle scattering experiment of Rutherford.

Please note that when Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of atom in
1911, even then only electrons and protons were known to be present in the atom.
This is because neutron was discovered much later in 1932. So, the original model of an atom
given by Rutherford contained only protons in the nucleus. It contained no neutrons. Rutherford’s
model of the atom was improved later on by including neutrons in the nucleus. We will study this
improved model of atom now.

RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

On the basis of alpha particle scattering experiment, Rutherford gave a nuclear model of the atom.
Rutherford’s model of atom (or structure of atom) can be described as follows:

1. An atom consists of a positively charged, dense and very small nucleus containing all the protons
and neutrons (protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge). Almost the
entire mass of an atom
is concentrated in the
nucleus.

speeds. The circular

of an atom. It contains all the protons

3. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and negatively charged
electrons holds the atom together.
4. An atom is electrically neutral. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom
is equal.
5. Most of the atom is empty space.
We will now describe the structures of some atoms on the basis of Rutherford’s model of atom.
The simplest atom is that of hydrogen. It contains one proton and one electron. According to
Rutherford’s theory, a hydrogen atom consists of a small nucleus containing one proton, and one electron
revolving around it (Figure 17). The nucleus is almost at the centre of the atom. Since the hydrogen
atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (1 each), it is electrically neutral. Please note

that the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom does not contain any neutrons in it.

The next simplest atom is that of helium. A helium atom consists of a small central nucleus
containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and there are 2 electrons revolving around this nucleus (Figure
18). Since the helium atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons (2 each), therefore, it
is electrically neutral.

Drawback of Rutherford’s Model of the Atom

A major drawback (or defect) of Rutherford’s model of the atom is that it does not explain the
stability of the atom. This point will become more clear from the following discussion.

In the Rutherford’s model of an atom, the negatively charged electrons are revolving around the
positively charged nucleus in circular paths. Now, we know that if an object moves in a circular path,
then its motion is said to be accelerated. This means that the motion of an electron revolving around

the nucleus is accelerated. Negatively

charged
electron

According to the electromagnetic theory of physics, if a
charged particle undergoes accelerated motion, then it must
radiate energy (or lose energy) continuously. Now, if we apply this
electromagnetic theory to the Rutherford’s model of an atom, it will
mean that the negatively charged electrons revolving around the

nucleus with accelerated motion, will lose their energy continuously Positively
pT 4 | charged

by radiation. Thus, the energy of revolving electrons will decrease nucleus

gradually and their speed will also go on decreasing. The electrons

will then be attracted more strongly by the oppositely charged Figure 19. Diagram to show how

nucleus due to which they will come more and more close to the anenergy losing electron could fall

nucleus. And ultimately the electrons should fall into the nucleus into the nucleus.
by taking a spiral path (as shown in Figure 19). This should make the atom very unstable and hence
the atom should collapse. ac

But this does not happen at all. We know that the electrons do not fall into the mY studygear
nucleus of an atom. Rather, atoms are very stable and do not collapse on their own.
The Rutherford’s model, however, does not explain the stability of an atom.

Neils Bohr Explained the Stability of Atom

In order to explain the stability of atom and overcome the objection against Rutherford’s model of
atom, Neils Bohr gave a new arrangement of electrons in the atom in 1913. According to Neils Bohr:

1. The electrons could revolve around the nucleus in only “certain orbits” (or “certain energy
levels”), each orbit having a different radius. The electrons in each orbit have a characteristic amount
of energy. The electrons which are in orbits close to the nucleus have low energy while those in orbits
farther from the nucleus have higher energy.

2. When an electron is revolving in a particular orbit or particular energy level around the nucleus,
the electron does not radiate energy (does not lose energy), even though it has accelerated motion around
the nucleus. And since the electrons do not lose energy while revolving in certain permitted orbits, they
do not fall into the nucleus, and hence the atom remains stable. Please note that the circular paths or
orbits around the nucleus (where the movement of electrons takes place), are also known as “energy
levels” or “electron shells”.

BOHR’S MODEL OF THE ATOM

The present concept of atom was given by Neils Bohr. The Bohr’s model of atom can be described
as follows:

1. An atom is made up of three particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have
negative charge, protons have positive charge whereas neutrons have no charge, they are neutral.
Due to the presence of equal number of negative electrons and positive protons, the atom on
the whole is electrically neutral.

2. The protons and neutrons are located in a small nucleus at the centre of the atom. Due to
the presence of protons, nucleus is positively charged.

3. The electrons revolve rapidly round the nucleus in fixed circular paths called energy levels
or shells. The energy levels or shells are represented in two ways: either by the numbers 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 or by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P (see Figure 21). The energy levels are counted
from the centre outwards.

4. There is a limit to the number of electrons which each energy level (or shell) can hold. For
example, the first energy level (or K shell) can hold a maximum of 2 electrons; second energy
level (or L shell) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons; third energy level (or M shell) can hold
a maximum of 18 electrons and fourth energy level (or N shell) can hold a maximum of
32 electrons.

5. Each energy level (or shell) is associated with a fixed amount of energy, the shell nearest
to the nucleus having minimum energy and the shell farthest from the nucleus having the
maximum energy.

6. There is no change in the energy of electrons as long as they keep revolving in the same
energy level, and the atom remains stable. The change in the energy of an electron takes place
only when it jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level or when it comes down
from a higher energy level to a lower energy level. When an electron gains energy, it jumps
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and when an electron comes down from a
higher energy level to a lower energy level, it loses energy.

ATOMIC NUMBER :

We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number
of protons present in an atom which determines its atomic number. We can define
atomic number as follows: The number of protons in one atom of an element is
known as atomic number of that element. That is:

Atomic number = Number of protons
of anelement in one atom of element

For example, one atom of sodium element has 11 protons in it, so the atomic number of sodium
is 11. Similarly, one atom of carbon element has 6 protons in it, so the atomic number of carbon is 6.
And a hydrogen atom has just 1 proton in its nucleus, therefore the atomic number of hydrogen is 1.
The atomic number of an element is denoted by the letter Z. The atomic number of sodium is 11,
so we can say that for sodium, Z = 11. The atomic number of carbon is 6, so for carbon, Z = 6. And
the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, therefore, for hydrogen, Z = 1.

All the atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in their nuclei, and hence
they have the same atomic number. Atoms of different elements have different number of protons
in their nuclei, so they have different atomic numbers. No two elements can have the same atomic
number. Since each element has its own fixed atomic number, therefore, atomic number can be used
to identify an element. For example, atomic number 6 tells us that it is carbon element. No other
element can have atomic number of 6. Thus, it is the number of protons (or atomic number) which
distinguishes the atoms of one element from the atoms of another element. The atoms of various

-elements are different because they have different atomic numbers (because of different number of
protons in them).

In a normal atom (or neutral atom), the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in
it. So, we can also say that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in
a neutral atom of that element. That is,
Atomic number = Number of electrons
of anelement in one neutral atom

For example, one neutral atom of sodium contains 11 electrons, so the atomic number of sodium is
11. It is very important to note here that the atomic number of an element is equal to the number
of electrons only in a neutral atom, and not in an ion because only a neutral atom contains an equal
number of protons and electrons. On the other hand, an ion is formed by the removal of electrons
from a normal atom or by the addition of electrons to a normal atom and, therefore, contains either
less or more electrons than protons.

Only the electrons of an atom take part in chemical reactions, the protons do not take part in a
chemical reaction. So, during a chemical reaction, the number of electrons in the atoms may change,
but the number of protons remains the same. Thus, the atomic number of an element does not change
during a chemical reaction, it remains the same.

It is clear from the above discussion that the atomic number of an element tells us two things:
1. It tells us the number of protons in one atom of the element.
2. It tells us the number of electrons in one normal atom of the element.

For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. It tells us that a sodium atom contains 11 protons.
It also tells us that a normal sodium atom contains 11 electrons. We will now discuss the mass number
of an element.

MASS NUMBER

An atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. Since the mass of electrons is negligible, the
real mass of an atom is determined by the protons and neutrons only. The total number of protons
and neutrons present in one atom of an element is known as its mass number. That is,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

For example, one atom of sodium element contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons, so the mass number
of sodium is 11 + 12 = 23. Similarly, a normal carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, so the mass
number of carbon is 6 + 6 = 12. And an ordinary hydrogen atom has 1 proton but 0 neutron (no
neutron), therefore, the mass number of ordinary hydrogen is just 1. The mass number of an element
is denoted by the letter A. The mass number of sodium is 23, so we can say that for sodium, A = 23.
The mass number of carbon is 12, so for carbon, A = 12. And the mass number of ordinary hydrogen
is 1, so for ordinary hydrogen, A = 1. Please note that protons and neutrons present in a nucleus, taken
together, are known as nucleons. So, we can also say that the total number of nucleons present in one
atom of an element is known as its mass number.

The mass number of an atom also gives us the atomic mass. This can be explained as follows.
We have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Now, Mass of a proton = 1 u
And, Mass of a neutron = lu
So, Mass number = No. of protons x 1 + No. of neutrons x 1
or Mass number = Mass of protons + Mass of neutrons
But the total mass of protons and neutrons is called atomic mass, so:
Mass number = Atomic mass
Thus, the mass number of an atom gives us the atomic mass of the atom. Actually, the atomic mass
of an atom is numerically equal to its mass number. For example, if the mass number of an atom is 23,
then its atomic mass will be 23 u.

Relationship Between Mass Number and Atomic Number

We will now derive a relationship between mass number and atomic number of an element. We
have just seen that:

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons
Since the number of protons in an atom is equal to the atomic number of the element, we can
rewrite the above relation by putting “Atomic number” in place of “No. of protons”. Thus:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
The atomic number and mass number can be indicated on the symbol of an element. The atomic
number is written on the lower left side of the symbol whereas mass number is written on the upper

left side of the symbol of the element. This is shown below:

Mass
number

Atomic | *
number

For example, an atom of carbon whose atomic number is 6 and mass number 12 is represented as:
ne
The lower figure (6) indicates the atomic number and the upper figure (12) indicates the mass
number of carbon. Lct us solve some problems now.
Calculate the atomic number of an element whose atomic nucleus has mass
number 23 and neutron number 12. What is the symbol of the element?
Nottscim We know that:
Mass number = Atomic number + No. of neutrons
So, 23 = Atomic number + 12
And, Atomic number = 23 - 12
=11

The element having atomic number 11 is sodium and its symbol is Na. If,
however, we indicate the atomic number and mass number also, then the symbol
becomes °*Na, where 11 is the atomic number and 23 is the mass number.

The number of electrons in an atom is 8 and the number of protons is also 8.
(a) What is the atomic number of the atom?
(b) What is the charge on the atom? (NCERT Book Question)

(a) Atomic number is equal to the number of protons in one atom. Since this
atom contains 8 protons, so the atomic number is 8.

(b) This atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons and
negatively charged electrons (8 each), so it has no overall charge. That is,
the charge on this atom is 0 (zero).

Wiiyt@ucoetaiiem Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How
many neutrons does it have? (NCERT Book Question)
We know that atomic mass is numerically equal to mass number of an atom.
Since the helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u, therefore, the mass number
of helium atom will be 4. And the number of protons in the helium nucleus
has been given to be 2. Now,

Mass number = No. of protons + No. of neutrons

So, 4 =2 +No. of neutrons
And, No.of neutrons =4-2
=

Thus, the helium atom has 2 neutrons.

ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRONS IN THE ATOMS
Electrons are negatively charged, so they form a cloud of negative charges outside the nucleus. In
this cloud, the electrons are arranged according to their potential energy in different energy levels or
shells. The energy levels of the electrons are denoted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas shells
are represented by the letters K, L, M, N, O and P.

Ist energy level is K shell

2nd energy level is L shell
3rd energy level is M shell
4th energy level is N shell, and so on.

electrons which can be

various shells

Figure 22. Energy levels or electron shells in an atom. (This figure shows only first four shells K, L, M and N)

The energy levels or shells are represented by circles around the nucleus. The shells are counted
from the centre outwards (see Figure 22). For example, K shell having the minimum energy is nearest
to the nucleus; L shell which has a little more energy is a bit farther away from the nucleus, and so on.
It is obvious that the outermost shell of an atom is at the highest energy level.

We will now describe how the electrons fill up the various energy levels or shells in an atom. It is a
well known fact that a system is most stable when it has the minimum energy. So, the electrons occupy

.the low energy levels first (this will make the atoms more stable). Now, K shell is at the lowest energy
level, so first of all the electrons fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on.

Electronic Configurations of Elements
The arrangement of electrons in the various shells (or energy levels) of an atom of the element

is known as electronic configuration of the element. In other words, electronic configuration is the
214 "Bilis bated baba es
distribution of electrons in various shells (or energy levels) of an atom such as K shell, L shell, M shell,
etc.
In order to write down the electronic configuration of an element, we should know two things:
(i) We should know the number of electrons in one atom of the element.
(ii) We should know the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in different
shells of the atom.

The number of electrons in an atom of the element is given by the atomic number of the element,
because the number of electrons in an atom of the element is equal to the atomic number of the
element. For example, if the atomic number of an element is 12, then its atom contains 12 electrons.

The maximum number of electrons which can be put in a particular energy level or shell was given
by Bohr and Bury. According to Bohr-Bury scheme:

1, The maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in any energy level of the
atom is given by 2n? (where n is the number of that energy level). Let us calculate the maximum
number of electrons which can be put in the first four energy levels of an atom.

(i) For 1st energy level, n = 1
So, The maximum number of electrons in 1st energy level = 2n?
= 2''(¥)
=2x1
=2
(ii) For 2nd energy level, n = 2
So, The maximum number of electrons in 2nd energy level = 2n?
=2~x (2)?
=2x4
=8
(iii) For 3rd energy level, n = 3
So, The maximum number of electrons in 3rd energy level = 2n?
. = 2 x (3)?
=2x9
= 18
(iv) For 4th energy level, n = 4
So, The maximum number of electrons in 4th energy level = 2n?
= 2 x (4)?
=2x 16
= 32
Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the first energy level is 2,
for second energy level is 8, for third energy level is 18, and for the fourth energy level is 32. Now,
the first energy level is called K shell, the second energy level is called L shell, the third energy level is
called M shell and the fourth energy level is known as N shell. So, we can also say that the maximum
number of electrons which can be accommodated in K shell is 2, for L shell is 8, for M shell is 18
and for N shell is 32. This can be put in the tabular form as follows:

Electron shell Maximum capacity

K shell 2 electrons
L shell 8 electrons
M shell 18 electrons
N shell 32 electrons
2. The outermost shell of an atom cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it has the
capacity to accommodate more electrons. (If, however, the outermost shell of an atom is the first
shell or K shell, then it cannot accommodate more than 2 electrons)

This means that normally, the outermost shell of an atom can take a maximum of 8 electrons only.
For example, if M shell is the outermost shell of an atom then it can hold a maximum of 8 electrons
only, though its maximum rated capacity is 18 electrons. This is due to the fact that “having 8 electrons
in the outermost shell” makes the atoms very stable. If, however, the outermost shell is the first shell
or K shell, then it can hold a maximum of 2 electrons only. This is because having 2 electrons in the
outermost shell when it is first shell or K shell (there being no other electron shells in the atom) also
makes the atom very stable. This happens in the case of helium element which has only one shell
(K shell) in its atom.

3. Electrons in an atom do not occupy a new shell unless all the inner shells are completely
filled with electrons

This means that the electron shells in an atom are filled in a step-wise manner. First of all the electrons
fill K shell, then L shell, M shell, N shell, and so on. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule
(which apply to elements having atomic numbers more than 18). We will study this in higher classes.

Keeping these points in mind, let us learn to write the electronic configurations of the elements.

Write the electronic configuration of an element X whose atomic number is 12.

Atomic number of the element X is 12 which means that one atom of X has
12 electrons. First of all the electrons will go to K shell which can take a

Sample Problem 1.

Solution.

maximum of 2 electrons. Thus, the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell and we
K
write 5 for it. After filling the K shell, the electrons will go to L shell. Now, L

L
shell can take a maximum of 8 electrons for which we write 3° In this way 2 + 8

= 10 electrons have beeri accommodated, and we are left with 2 more electrons.

M
The remaining 2 electrons go to M shell and we write - for it. Writing all the

electron shells together, the electronic configuration of the element X becomes:

KLM

2,852
Please note that it is not necessary to write
the shells K, L and M, etc., while writing the
electronic configurations of the elements.
For example, the electronic configuration
of the element X of atomic number 12 can
be simply written as 2, 8, 2. It is, however,
better to indicate their shells also. Another
point to be noted is that we have given so
many details in the solution of this problem
just to make you understand the things
clearly. There is no need to write so many details in the exam. The arrangement
of electrons in the atom of element X has been shown in Figure 23.

F Sample Problem 2.) Write the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom. (Atomic number of carbon

of 6 electrons:

(i) the first 2 electrons will occupy K shell. For this we write ied
L

(ii) the remaining 6 - 2 = 4 electrons will go to L shell. For this we write ,-

So, the distribution of electrons in a carbon atom ( or the electronic configuration

of a carbon atom) will be:

Sample Problem 3.) Write the electronic configuration of sodium atom. (Atomic number of sodium
= 11) (NCERT Book Question)

The atomic number of sodium is 11. This means that a normal sodium atom
contains 11 electrons. Out of 11 electrons of sodium atom, the first 2 electrons
will occupy K shell, the next 8 electrons will occupy L shell and the remaining
1 electron will go to M shell. So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom
will be:

F Sample Problem 4.) What would be the electronic configuration of a positively charged sodium ion,
Na‘? What would be its atomic number?

The atomic number of sodium is 11. So, a neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11

electrons in it.

(i) A positively charged sodium ion (Na*) is formed by the removal of 1 electron
from a sodium atom. So, a sodium ion has 11 - 1 = 10 electrons in it. Thus,

KL
the electronic configuration of a sodium ion will be or 2, 8.

(ii) The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its

atom. Since a sodium atom as well as a sodium ion contain the same number

- of protons, therefore, the atomic number of sodium ion is the same as that
of a sodium atom, which is 4,

Sample Problem 5. Explain why, sodium ion, Na*, has completely filled K and L shells.
(NCERT Book Question)
F Solution.] A sodium ion, Na*, has 10 electrons in it. Now, the maximum capacity of
K shell is 2 electrons and that of L shell is 8 electrons. Taken together, the
maximum capacity of K and L shells is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. A sodium ion Na*
has completely filled K and L shells because its 10 electrons can completely fill

up K and L shells.
F Sample Problem 6.] If both K and L shells of an atom are full, what is the total number of electrons
in the atom? (NCERT Book Question)
K shell becomes full with 2 electrons and L shell becomes full with 8 electrons.
So, if the K and L shells of an atom are full, then it will have a total of 2+ 8=10
electrons in it.

An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of the
element?

There are 2 electrons in the M shell of the atom of this element. This means
that the K and L shells of the atom of this element (which come before M shell)
are completely filled with electrons. Now, K shell can accommodate 2 electrons,
L shell can accommodate 8 electrons and we have been given that M shell has
2 electrons. So, the electronic configuration of this element becomes 2, 8, 2.
Thus, the number of electrons in its atom is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12. Since the number
of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, therefore, the
atomic number of this element is 12.

of potassium (2, 8, 8, 1) and calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) having atomic numbers 19 and 20 respectively. We
know that M shell can accommodate up to 18 electrons but in the case of potassium and calcium,
the M shell has only 8 electrons when the next electrons enter the N shell. That is, the fourth energy
shell N has started to fill up even before the third energy shell M is complete with 18 electrons. This
abnormal behaviour of potassium and calcium will be explained in higher classes. Before we go further

)

The outermost electron shell of an atom is known as valence shell. The electrons present in the
outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons (or valency electrons) because they
decide the valency (combining capacity) of the atom. Only the valence electrons of an atom take part

in chemical reactions because they have more energy than all the inner electrons of the atom. Let us .

take the example of sodium atom to understand the meaning of valence electrons clearly.

The atomic number of sodium is 11, which means that one sodium atom has 11 electrons in it.

223
So, the electronic configuration of sodium atom will be a Valence electron

Kel
a a In the sodium atom, M shell is the outermost

shell or valence shell (see Figure 24). There is 1 electron
in the outermost shell of sodium atom, therefore, sodium
atom has | valence electron.

Outermost shell
(Valence shell)

When a sodium atom combines with other atoms,
only its one valence electron (in the M shell) takes part
in chemical reactions. The electrons of two inner shells

(K shell and L shell) of the sodium atom never take part
in chemical reactions. Figure 24. Sodium atom has one valence electron
(which has been marked 1 in the above figure).

We can now say that those electrons of an atom
which take part in chemical reactions are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are located
in the outermost shell of an atom. In a chemical reaction, valence electrons of an atom are either
transferred to the valence electrons of another atom, or shared with the valence electrons of another
atom.

(i) The elements Hydrogen, Lithium, Sodium and Potassium have 1 valence electron each in their atoms.

(ii) The elements Helium, Beryllium, Magnesium and Calcium have 2 valence electrons each in their
atoms.

(iii) The elements Boron and Aluminium have 3 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(iv) The elements Carbon and Silicon have 4 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(v) The elements Nitrogen and Phosphorus have 5 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vi) The elements Oxygen and Sulphur have 6 valence electrons each in their atoms.

(vii) The elements Fluorine and Chlorine have 7 valence electrons each in their atoms.
(viii) The elements Neon and Argon have 8 valence electrons each in their atoms.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element, we should write
down the electronic configuration of the element by using its atomic number. The outermost shell
will be the valence shell and the number of electrons present in it will give us the number of valence
electrons. This point will become more clear from the following example.

What is the number of valence electrons in the atom of an element X having
atomic number 17? Name the valence shell of this atom.

In order to find out the number of valence electrons, we should write down the
electronic configuration of element X. The atomic number of element X is 17,
so one atom of X contains 17 electrons. The electronic configuration will be:

KLM
2BR7

Here M shell is the outermost shell or valence shell of the atom and it has 7 electrons in it. Thus,
- there are 7 valence electrons in the atom of element X.

Before we can understand valency (or combining capacity) of elements, it is necessary to know why the

elements called noble gases (or inert gases) are chemically unreactive and why atoms of elements combine with
one another. This is discussed below.
Inertness of Noble Gases

There are some elements which do not combine with other elements. These elements are: Helium,
Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon and Radon. They are known as noble gases or inert gases because they
do not react with other elements to form compounds. We know that only the outermost electrons
of an atom take part in a chemical reaction. Since the noble gases are chemically unreactive, we
must conclude that the electron arrangements in their atoms are very stable which do not allow
the outermost electrons to take part in chemical reactions. We will now write down the electronic
configurations of the noble gases to find out the exact reason for their inert nature.

If we look at the number of electrons in the outermost shells of the inert gases in the above table, we
find that only one inert gas helium has 2 electrons in its outermost shell, all other inert gases have
8 electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms. We know that the outermost shell of an atom can
accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons (except when the outermost shell is K shell and it can hold
only a maximum of 2 electrons). This means that all the noble gases have completely filled outermost
shells. Since the atoms of inert gases are very stable and have 8 electrons in their outermost shells,
therefore, to have 8 electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is considered to be the most stable
arrangement of electrons. To have ‘8 electrons’ in the outermost shell of an atom is known as ‘octet’ of
electrons. Most of the inert gases have octet of electrons in their valence shells. From this discussion
we conclude that the atoms having 8 electrons (or octet of electrons) in their outermost shell are
very stable and hence chemically unreactive.

Please note that 2 electrons in the outermost shell is considered to be a stable arrangement of
electrons only when the atom has just one shell, K shell, and there are no other electron shells in
the atom. To have ‘2 electrons’ in the outermost K shell is known as ‘duplet’ of electrons. Helium is
the only inert gas having a duplet of electrons in its outermost shell. It is very important to note here
that though 8 electrons in the outermost shell always impart stability to an atom, but 2 electrons
in the outermost shell impart stability only when the outermost shell is the first shell (K shell), and
no other shells are present in the atom.

It should be noted that noble gases are unreactive because they have very stable electron arrangements
with 8 (or 2) electrons in their outermost shells. In other words, the noble gas atoms have completely
filled outermost shells. It is not possible to remove electrons from the outermost shell of a noble
gas atom or to add electrons to the outermost shell of a noble gas atom. Due to this the outermost
electrons of a noble gas atom cannot take part in chemical reactions. Since the atoms of inert gases
are very stable or unreactive they can exist in the free state as individual atoms. So, the inert gases
are monoatomic, that is, inert gases exist as single atoms. Their atoms and molecules are just the same.
For example, helium, neon, argon, etc., all exist in the form of monoatomic molecules He, Ne, Ar, etc.

Cause of Chemical Combination

Everything in this world wants to become more stable. For atoms, stability means having the electron
arrangement of an inert gas. The atoms combine with one another to achieve the inert gas electron
arrangement and become more stable. So, when atoms combine to form chemical compounds, they do
so in such a way that each atom gets 8 electrons in its outermost shell or 2 electrons in the outermost
K shell. In other words, the atoms having less than 8 electrons (or less than 2 electrons) in their outermost
shell are unstable. So, all the atoms have a tendency to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of
8 electrons (or 2 electrons) in their outermost shells and become more stable.

An atom can achieve the inert gas (or noble gas) electron arrangement in three ways:
(i) by losing one or more electrons (to another atom)

(ii) by gaining one or more electrons (from another atom)

(iii) by sharing one or more electrons (with another atom)

If an element has 1, 2 or 3 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it loses these electrons
to achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons and forms positively charged
ion or cation (It is not possible to add 7, 6 or 5 electrons to an atom due to energy considerations).

If an element has 5, 6 or 7 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it gains (accepts)
electrons to achieve the stable, inert gas configuration of eight valence electrons, and forms negatively
charged ion called anion (It is not possible to remove 5, 6 or 7 electrons from an atom due to very
high energy required).

If, however, an element has 4 electrons in the outermost shell of its atom, then it can neither lose
4 electrons nor gain 4 electrons due to energy considerations. An element having 4 electrons in the
outermost shell of its atom can achieve the inert gas electron arrangement of eight valence electrons
only by sharing its 4 outermost electrons with the 4 electrons of the other atoms.

VALENCY OF ELEMENTS

When atoms of one element combine with the atoms of another element to form a compound, they
do so in fixed numbers depending upon the capacities of the atoms to form bonds. The capacity of
an atom of an element to form chemical bonds is known as its valency. The valency of an element
decides the number of other atoms which can combine with one atom of that element. For example,

the valency of carbon is 4 and that of hydrogen is 1. So, one atom of carbon can combine with four
atoms of hydrogen to form a methane molecule, CHy. The valency of an element is also known as
“valence” of the element, “combining capacity” of the element or “combining number” of the element.
The valency of an element is decided by the “number of valence electrons” in its atom. In other
words, the valency of an element is decided by the “number of outermost electrons” in its atom. This
is discussed below.

Relation Between Valency and Valence Electrons

The valency of an element depends on the number of valence electrons (outermost electrons) in
its atom because only the valence electrons take part in chemical bonding. The valency of an element
is either equal to the number of valence electrons in its atom or equal to the number of electrons
required to complete eight electrons in the valence shell. For example, sodium has 1 valence electron
and the valency of sodium is also 1. So, in the case of sodium, the valency is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. In general, the valency of a metal element is equal to the number of
valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a metal = No. of valence electrons in its atom

Let us discuss the case of non-metals now. Chlorine has 7 valence electrons but its valency is not 7.
Chlorine atom requires 1 electron to complete the 8 electron structure, so the valency of chlorine
is 1. Thus, in the case of chlorine, valency is equal to the number of electrons required to complete
8 electrons in the valence shell. In general, the valency of a non-metal element is usually equal to
eight minus the number of valence electrons in its atom. That is,

Valency of a non-metal = 8 - No. of valence electrons in its atom

There is one exception to this rule and that is the valency of hydrogen. The valency of hydrogen is
equal to the number of valence electrons, which is 1 (though hydrogen is a non-metal element).

Types of Valency

There are two types of valency: Electrovalency and Covalency. If an element combines by the
loss or gain of electrons to form electrovalent compounds (or ionic compounds), its valency is known
as electrovalency, and if an element combines by the sharing of electrons to form covalent compounds
(or molecular compounds), its valency is known as covalency. We will now discuss these two types of
valency in detail. Let us take the case of electrovalency first.

1. ELECTROVALENCY

In the formation of an electrovalent compound (or ionic compound), the number of electrons
lost or gained by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration
is known as its electrovalency. The elements which lose electrons form positive ions, so they have
positive electrovalency. The elements which gain electrons form negative ions, so they have negative
electrovalency. The following examples will make it more clear.

(a) Valency of Sodium

The atomic number of sodium is 11, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 1. It has 1 electron in
its outermost shell. Sodium atom can lose this electron to form a sodium ion, Na’, having an inert gas
electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since a sodium atom loses 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the valency of sodium is 1 (or 1+). The atomic number of potassium is 19
and its valency is also 1. Similarly, the atomic number of lithium is 3 and its valency is also 1. Explain
these two cases yourself.

(b) Valency of Magnesium

The atomic number of magnesium is 12, and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. It has 2 electrons
in its valence shell. The magnesium atom can lose these two outermost electrons to form a magnesium
ion, Mg?*, having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one magnesium atom loses
2 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, the valency of magnesium is
2 (or 2+). The atomic number of calcium is 20 and its valency is also 2. Similarly, the atomic number
of beryllium (Be) is 4 and its valency is also 2. Explain these two cases yourself.

(c) Valency of Aluminium

The atomic number of aluminium is 13, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 3. It has 3 electrons
in its outermost shell. The aluminium atom can lose these 3 electrons to form the aluminium ion, Al**,
having an inert gas electron configuration of 2, 8. Since one atom of aluminium loses 3 electrons to
achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so the valency of aluminium is 3 (or 3+). The atomic
number of boron (B) is 5 and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.

(d) Valency of Chlorine

The atomic number of chlorine is 17, so its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 7. The chlorine atom has
7 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 1 more electron to achieve the 8-electron configuration. So, the
chlorine atom gains (accepts) 1 electron to form a chloride ion, CI’, having an inert gas electron arrangement
of 2, 8, 8. Since one chlorine atom gains 1 electron to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so
the electrovalency of chlorine is 1 (or 1-). Fluorine has atomic number 9, and its electrovalency is also
1(or 1-). Explain it yourself. The other halogens bromine and iodine also have 7 valence electrons each
and need 1 electron each to achieve the inert gas electron arrangements. So, bromine and iodine also
have the valency of 1 (or 1-).

(e) Valency of Oxygen

The atomic number of oxygen is 8, so its electronic configuration is 2, 6. The oxygen atom has
6 valence electrons, so it needs 2 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure. The oxygen atom
gains (accepts) 2 electrons to form an oxide ion, O?-, having an inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8.
Since one atom of oxygen requires 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement,
so the electrovalency of oxygen is 2 (or 2-). The atomic number of sulphur is 16 and its valency is
also 2. Explain it yourself.

(f) Valency of Nitrogen

The atomic number of nitrogen is 7, so its electronic configuration is 2, 5. Nitrogen atom has
- 5 electrons in its outermost shell and it needs 3 more electrons to complete the 8-electron structure.
Thus, the nitrogen atom gains 3 electrons to form a nitride ion, N°>-, having an inert gas electron
configuration of 2, 8. Since one nitrogen atom needs 3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas
electron arrangement, so the electrovalency of nitrogen is 3 (or 3-). The atomic number of phosphorus
is 15, and its valency is also 3. Explain it yourself.
The atoms of inert gases like helium, neon, argon, etc., have completely filled outermost shells, so
they can neither lose electrons nor gain electrons. Due to this, inert gases have “zero valency” and
are chemically unreactive. We will discuss the covalency now.

2. COVALENCY

In the formation of a covalent compound (or molecular compound), the number of electrons
shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas electron configuration is known
as its covalency. If an atom shares 1 electron, its covalency will be 1, if it shares 2 electrons, then its
valency will be 2, and so on. This point will become more clear from the following examples.

(a) Covalency of Hydrogen

The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, so its
electronic configuration is 1. A hydrogen atom has
1 electron in its outermost shell, which is K shell, so it needs
1 more electron to achieve the 2-electron inert gas electron
arrangement of helium and become stable. Hydrogen atom
gets this electron by sharing. Since one atom of hydrogen
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron
configuration, therefore, the covalency (or just valency) of
hydrogen is 1. For example, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule H,, two hydrogen atoms share
1 electron with each other to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, so the valency of
hydrogen in H, molecule is 1. Please note that the shared electrons are counted with both the combining
atoms for the purpose of determining their inert gas electron configuration.

Figure 28. Look at these girls! They appear
to form a hydrogen molecule (H-H or H,).

(b) Covalency of Chlorine

A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outermost shell, so it can share its 1 electron with one electron
of another atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement. Since one chlorine atom
shares 1 electron to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of chlorine is 1. For example, in the formation of a chlorine molecule, Cl, each
chlorine atom shares its 1 electron with the other atom, so the valency of chlorine in Cl, molecule is 1.

(c) Covalency of Oxygen

An oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons, so it can share its 2 electrons with two electrons of another
atom to achieve the 8-electron inert gas electron arrangement and become stable. Since one oxygen atom
shares 2 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the covalency
(or just valency) of oxygen is 2. For example, in the formation of an oxygen molecule, O,, each oxygen
atom shares its 2 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of oxygen in the O, molecule is 2.

(d) Covalency of Nitrogen

A nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons, so it can share its 3 electrons with three electrons of
another atom to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron configuration. Since one nitrogen atom shares
3 electrons to achieve the nearest inert gas electronic configuration, therefore, the covalency (or
just valency) of nitrogen is 3. For example, in the formation of a nitrogen molecule, N>, each nitrogen
atom shares its 3 electrons with the other atom, so the valency of nitrogen in the N, molecule is 3.
(e) Covalency of Carbon

The atomic number of carbon is 6, so its electronic configuration
is 2, 4. Thus, a carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and it requires
4 more electrons to complete the ‘octet. It gets these electrons by
sharing. So, a carbon atom shares its 4 electrons with the four
electrons of other atoms to attain the 8-electron inert gas electron
arrangement. Since one carbon atom shares its 4 electrons
to attain the inert gas electron arrangement, therefore, the
covalency (or just valency) of carbon is 4. For example, in the
formation of a methane molecule, CH,, the carbon atom shares Figure 29. Model of methane
its 4 electrons with four electrons of four hydrogen atoms, so the ne cae (Gris:
valency of carbon in CH, molecule is 4. The atomic number of silicon is 14 and its i¥etis dygear
valency is also 4. Explain it yourself.

The elements like fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and sulphur,
etc., form electrovalent compounds as well as covalent compounds, so they show
electrovalency as well as covalency. Please note that the electrovalency and covalency
of an element are numerically the same. So, we usually talk of just valency and not
electrovalency or covalency. Let us now solve some problems based on valency.

iiiacoutnee What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 12?

To find out the valency of the element, we will have to write down its electronic
configuration. Now, the atomic number of this element is 12, so its electronic

configuration will be aes . . It has 2 electrons in its outermost shell (M

shell). So, one atom of this ‘element can lose 2 electrons to achieve the nearest
inert gas electron arrangement of 2, 8. Since one atom of the element loses 2
electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, so its valency is 2. It
is divalent. (The element having atomic number 12 is actually magnesium).

Siietaeciecnwes What valency will be shown by an element having atomic number 15?
The atomic number of this element is 15, so its electronic configuration will be

= : = It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell, so it needs 3 more electrons to
complete the eight electron, inert gas configuration. Since one atom of this element
needs 3 electrons to achieve the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency
is 3. (The element having atomic number 15 is actually phosphorus).

If Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also name the element.
(NCERT Book Question)

The symbol Z stands for the atomic number of an element. By saying that
Z = 3, we mean that the atomic number of this element is 3. The electronic

Sample Problem 3.

configuration of the element having atomic number 3 is It has 1 electron

>
in its outermost shell (L shell). So, one atom of this element can lose 1 electron
to achieve the nearest inert gas electron arrangement of . (which is the same
as that of helium gas). Since one atom of this element loses 1 electron to achieve
230

the inert gas electron configuration, therefore, its valency is 1. The element
having atomic number 3 is lithium.

The number of valence electrons in a chloride ion, Cl-, are:
(a) 16 (b) 8 (c) 17 (d) 18
Choose the correct answer. (NCERT Book Question)

A chlorine atom (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. A chloride ion is formed by
the addition of 1 more electron to a chlorine atom. So, the number of valence
electrons in a chloride ion (CI-) will be 7 + 1 = 8.

ISOTOPES

In nature, most of the elements have a number of atoms which have the ‘same atomic number’
but ‘different mass numbers. Such atoms of an element are called ‘isotopes. Thus: Isotopes are atoms
of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isotopes of an
element have the same atomic number because they contain the same number of protons (and electrons).
Isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they contain different number of neutrons.
It is clear that the isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Let us
take an example to understand the meaning of isotopes more clearly.

All the chlorine atoms contain 17 protons, so the atomic number of all the chlorine atoms is
17. Now, some chlorine atoms have 18 neutrons whereas other chlorine atoms contain 20 neutrons.
Chlorine atoms can, therefore, have mass numbers of 17 + 18 = 35 or 17 + 20 = 37. Thus, chlorine has
two isotopes of mass numbers 35 and 37 respectively. The two isotopes of chlorine can be written as:

vcl and Tat

Both of these chlorine isotopes have the same atomic number of 17 but different mass numbers
of 35 and 37 respectively. The complete composition of the two isotopes of chlorine is given below:

It should be noted that the mass number of an atom is equal to its atomic mass. So, we can also use
the term “atomic mass” in place of “mass number” in the definition of isotopes and say that: isotopes
are atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different atomic masses. Please
note that the difference in the masses of
isotopes of an element is due to the different
number of neutrons in their nuclei. For
example, the two isotopes of chlorine contain
different number of 18 and 20 neutrons, and
hence they have different atomic masses of
35 u and 37 u respectively. It should be clear
by now that whether we use the term “mass
number” or “atomic mass” in the definition
of isotopes, it means the same thing. Another
point to be noted is that if they ask the nuclear
composition of isotopes in the examination,
then we should give the number of protons
and neutrons present in the nucleus of each isotope. For example,

(i) Nuclear composition of Cl isotope = 17 protons + 18 neutrons

chlorine (The blue balls represent protons whereas yellow balls
represent neutrons).

(ii) Nuclear composition of “Cl isotope = 17 protons + 20 neutrons
Please note that the isotopes of an element can also be represented by writing their mass numbers
with the name of the element or symbol of the element. For example:
(i) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 35 can also be represented as chlorine-35 (or just
Cl-35), and
(ii) The isotope of chlorine having mass number 37 can also be represented as chlorine-37 (or just
Cl-37).
We will now give some more examples of isotopes of the various elements such as hydrogen, carbon,
oxygen and neon.
1. Isotopes of Hydrogen. The hydrogen element has three isotopes having the same atomic number
of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The three isotopes of hydrogen can be
represented as:

ft, pe et

The three isotopes of hydrogen, iH,7H and +H have been given the special names of protium,
deuterium and tritium respectively.
(i) Protium is the ordinary hydrogen isotope of mass number 1. Protium is represented as iH

Protium does not have a special symbol.
(ii) Deuterium is the heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 2. Deuterium is represented as {H.

The special symbol of deuterium is D.
(iii) Tritium is the very heavy hydrogen isotope of mass number 3. Tritium is represented as 7H.

The special symbol of tritium is T.
Thus, we can now say that hydrogen element has three isotopes: protium, deuterium and tritium,
having the same atomic number of 1 but different mass numbers of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

The complete composition of the three isotopes of hydrogen is given below:

Name Isotope Protons Neutrons Electrons
Protium iH 1 0 1
Deuterium TH 1 1 1
Tritium 7H 1 2 1
It is clear from the above table that all the isotopes of hydrogen contain 1 proton and | electron
each but they contain 0, 1 and 2 neutrons respectively. Please note that the ordinary hydrogen isotope
(protium) does not contain any neutron; the heavy hydrogen isotope (deuterium) contains 1 neutron;
whereas the very heavy hydrogen isotope (tritium) contains 2 neutrons.

2. Isotopes of Carbon. The carbon element has three isotopes having the same atomic number of
6 but different mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14. The three isotopes of carbon can be written as:

Bae 2c ands..1C
These three isotopes of carbon contain 6 protons and 6 electrons each but they contain an unequal

number of neutrons. The C-12 isotope contains 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons, C-13 isotope contains 13 - 6 = 7
neutrons whereas the C-14 isotope contains 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons.

3. Isotopes of Oxygen. The oxygen element has three isotopes:
) vieeryO and. UO

8
All the isotopes of oxygen have the same atomic number of 8 but they have different mass numbers

(or atomic masses) of 16, 17 and 18 respectively.
4. Isotopes of Neon. The neon element has also three isotopes which can be written as:

20. 21 22
Ne, jgNe and jNe

It is obvious from the above symbols that all the isotopes of neon have the same atomic number
of 10 but they have different mass numbers (or atomic masses) of 20, 21 and 22 respectively. We will
now discuss why all the isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties.

All the Isotopes of an Element Have Identical Chemical Properties

The chemical properties of an atom of the element depend on the number of protons and electrons,
not on the number of neutrons. Since all the isotopes of an element contain the same number of protons
and electrons, therefore, the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are identical (or same).
We can explain the identical chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element on the basis of
their electronic configurations as follows.

All the isotopes of an element contain the same number of electrons because of which they have
identical electronic configurations having the same number of valence electrons. Since all the isotopes
of an element have identical electronic configurations containing the same number of valence
electrons, therefore, all the isotopes of an element show identical chemical properties. For example,
the two isotopes of chlorine, ur and wee , both have the same number of 17 electrons in them due
to which both of them have the same electronic configuration of 2, 8, 7. Since both the isotopes of
chlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37, have identical electronic configurations (having the same number of 7 valence
electrons), they show identical chemical properties.

The Physical Properties of the Isotopes of an Element are Different

The physical properties of an element depend on the mass of the atoms. Now, due to the presence
of different number of neutrons, the masses of all the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Since
the masses of the isotopes of an element are slightly different, therefore, the physical properties of
the isotopes of an element are slightly different. Thus, the various isotopes of an element can have
slightly different physical properties such as densities, melting points and boiling points, etc. (because
all these physical properties depend on the masses of the isotopes). For example, the two isotopes of
chlorine, *c] and *’c}, have slightly different physical properties because they have slightly different
atomic masses of 35 u and 37 u, respectively.

Reason for the Fractional Atomic Masses of Elements

The atomic masses of many elements are in fractions and not
whole numbers. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 u
whereas that of copper is 63.5 u. The fractional atomic masses of
elements are due to the existence of their isotopes having different
masses. Most of the elements have more than one natural isotope
having different masses. Since the atomic mass of an element is the
average relative mass of all the natural isotopes of that element, most
elements have fractional atomic masses. For example, chlorine has two _ Figure 33. This flask contains
isotopes tl and wi with abundance of 75% and 25% respectively. chlorine. Chlorine consists of two
In other words, natural chlorine consists of two types of atoms, one _ types of atoms, one having a mass
having a mass of 35 u and the other having a mass of 37 uin the — f35 uand the other having amass
proportion of 75% and 25% respectively. Thus, the average mass of a sat atthe ree teamin
chlorine atom will be 75% of 35 and 25% of 37, which is 35.5 u. This
gives us the atomic mass of chlorine as 35.5 u. The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine will
become more clear from the following discussion.

(i) The chlorine isotope *°c| has a mass of 35 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 75%.

(ii) The chlorine isotope 7Cl has a mass of 37 u and its abundance (or proportion) in nature is 25%.

This means that the isotope of mass 35 u will contribute 75 per cent to the average atomic mass

of chlorine whereas the isotope of mass 37 u will contribute 25 per cent to the average atomic mass
of chlorine. So,

Average atomic mass of chlorine = 35 eta + 37x bes
